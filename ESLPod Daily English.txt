### 0001 Introducing Yourself

Let me tell you a little about myself.

I was born and raised in Minnesota and I’m a native of the city of Saint Paul. I grew up there with my parents and my eight brothers and two sisters. I’m the eleventh child, so you could say I’m the baby of the family, but I swear I wasn’t spoiled.

That’s right, I’m part of a big family, probably the biggest family in the neighborhood, perhaps the biggest family in the state!

I had a happy childhood, for the most part. My father and mother didn’t have a lot of money, but because they both worked hard, we never felt deprived.

I wasn’t much interested in sports, like my brothers were. I enjoyed reading and listening to music while growing up. I went to grade school near my house, and then to high school about two miles away from our home.

After graduating from high school, I went on to the University of Minnesota for my bachelor’s degree. It took me a while to learn the ropes at the university, but I finally graduated about six years later. Better late than never, as my father used to say.

I then went to Mexico for a couple of years to teach English and to study Spanish. When I returned, I decided to become a teacher, so I went back to school to get my master’s degree. After teaching high school for a few years, I was offered a job in California, so I moved to Los Angeles in 1991. After working here for a few years, I went back to school (again!) to get my Ph.D. I was starting to become a professional student.

Well, I completed my Ph.D. in four years and then taught at the university for several years. Now I work at a small research organization here in Los Angeles. I am happily married, and I still enjoy reading and listening to music, and of course, creating ESLPod.com lessons.

### 0002 Getting Up

The worst part of the day for me is definitely when I have to get up. Waking up, that I can handle. But getting up? That, I hate. The covers I have on my bed are heavy, mostly because I have a comforter as well as a light blanket. I sleep with two pillows, which for some reason have different color pillowcases. Well, at least the sheets match.

I sometimes wake up before the alarm goes off. I like to keep the alarm at a low volume, with some classical music, nothing too jarring. My old roommate used to like the terrible buzzer that you find on most alarm clocks nowadays, which always used to drive me nuts. As I was saying, I sometimes wake up before the alarm, usually because of some noise outside the house—a car door slamming, an alarm going off, gunfire—well, okay, not gunfire, but man, is my neighborhood noisy! Of course, when I’m staying in a hotel, it’s usually easier to just get a wake up call from the hotel than set the alarm.

I’m not really an early riser, so I don’t jump out of bed ready to take on the world. I get up very slowly, usually one foot on the floor at a time. Every once in a while I’ll oversleep, but not too often. I really love the weekends, when I can sleep in.

### 0003 Cleaning Up

I go into my bathroom sometime around 6:45 a.m. My sink and medicine cabinet are on the left when you enter my bathroom. The toilet is next to that, with the tub in front. Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the mouthwash in the medicine cabinet. I pour a small amount into a cup, swish it around for 30 seconds, gargle, and spit. Not pleasant, but necessary. Then I get out the floss. When I’m done flossing, I pull out the toothbrush and the toothpaste. I brush and then it’s off to the shower.
I pull the shower curtain aside, step into the tub, and pull the curtain back. I turn on both the hot and the cold water, looking for the perfect temperature. I lather up with soap, put some shampoo in my hair, then rinse and dry off. Now it’s shaving time. I used to own an electric razor, but I found it didn’t shave close enough. So now I’m back to the old hand razor. I lather up with shaving cream, and I start to shave. I rinse the razor and throw the disposable blades in the trash. It’s about 7:00 AM, and I’m on to breakfast.

### 0004 Eating Breakfast

I walk into my kitchen and turn on the coffeemaker. I always put the coffee, filter, and water in the night before so it’s ready to go. Next, I open the door of the cupboard where the cereal is stored. I would love to have ham and eggs for breakfast every morning, or maybe a stack of waffles, but the truth is that I just don’t have the time to cook.

So, I pour myself a bowl of cereal and put in a glass of skim milk, making sure I take a spoon out of the silverware tray. I go outside and pick up my newspaper, and sit down at the kitchen table. I love reading the paper in the morning, though usually I just have time to read a few of the stories. When I’ve finished my cereal, I grab a banana and maybe make a slice of toast with jam. I rinse off my breakfast dishes in the sink and put them in the dishwasher. By that time, my coffee is ready so I pour myself a cup and put the rest in a Thermos for work.

### 0005 Getting Dressed & Ready for Work

I go back into my bedroom and open up my closet door. I have about 30 dress shirts, 10 pairs of pants, a half-dozen ties, and some sweaters, suit jackets, and t-shirts. I pull out a clean pair of socks and underwear, and then decide which shirt I’m going to wear today. I’m terrible at color coordinating, so I usually bring my wife in at this point to help match my shirt and pants. I put on my belt with the silver buckle and polish my shoes. I put my cell phone and car keys in my front pocket, and my wallet in the back one.

I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror to make sure I look okay, and then go into the home office to get my bag. I used to carry a more traditional briefcase, but now I just use my computer bag to hold my laptop and my papers. Now it’s back into the kitchen to grab my Thermos on the way out the door. I lock the door and then hurry to my car in the garage. I’m usually running late and today is no exception!

### 0006 The Commute to Work

I open my car door and throw my briefcase in the back seat, and get comfortable for my drive. I put my coffee mug into the cup holder, put the keys in the ignition, find the gas pedal, and start the car. My wife drove the car last night, so I have to re-adjust the rear view mirror and the side mirrors. I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time traffic report. I take the transmission out of park and into reverse, back out into the driveway into the street, close the garage door, and put the car into drive. I used to drive a stick shift, but as I get older, I like my automatic transmission more and more.

I usually take the freeway to the office, so I get on the onramp for the freeway and drive to where I have to get off. My office is only a few miles from the exit. I pull into the parking garage, swiping my key card to get in. I park, grab my briefcase and coffee, and head toward the elevator. And that only took 40 minutes!

### 0007 At My Desk, on Break, and at Lunch

On the way to the office, I was thinking about what I have on my agenda today. When I get to my desk, there is a stack of new memos and papers in my inbox. When I turn on my computer, I see at least two-dozen emails I need to go through. Just as I start in on the email, my phone rings. It’s my project manager, Julie, asking me to come in for a conference call with our head office. I don’t get back to my desk for nearly two hours. By that time, I was ready for a break.

At 10:30, I head down to the break room and get some hot water at the water cooler to make some tea. There were a couple of other people on break, having snacks out of the vending machine and reading the new notices on the bulletin board. I run into Sam, one of my friends at work, and we chat a little before going back to work.

Before long, it’s time for lunch. I usually bring my lunch with me to work and eat it at my desk. If I don’t have time to pack a lunch, I sometimes go across the street for some take-out. The only trouble is, it’s always so busy during the lunch hour and I always have to stand in line. That’s usually a pain. On Fridays, I usually go out to lunch with a few friends from work. On casual Fridays, we can kick back a little and take it easy.

### 0008 The Commute Home and Running Errands

It’s five o’clock and it’s quitting time. I put a few files into my bag, grab my mug, and say goodnight to the rest of the people in my area. I go to the parking garage and get into my car. I signal my turn onto the street and drive toward the freeway onramp. I merge as best as I can onto the freeway, which is always a bit of a hassle at this hour. Traffic is stop-and-go all the way from downtown. I hear on the radio that there’s a stalled car in fast lane near La Brea, backing up traffic all the way to Hoover. I decide to get off the freeway and to take surface streets for the rest of the trip.

I need to make a stop on the way home. I know that the fridge is empty, so I decide to stop by the market. I get there and I pick up some French bread, a bag of apples, a few bananas, some pasta, tomato sauce, and a cooked chicken. Luckily, they have a lot of checkout stands open, and I get through the line pretty quickly. I thank the cashier and the bagger and push my cart to my car. I open the trunk and load everything up. Just then my wife calls me on my cell phone. She was going to be a little late getting home and asks me to make something for dinner. Tonight, I will be the cook.

### 0009 Making Dinner, Eating Dinner

When I get home, I start on dinner right away. I clean off the kitchen counter after putting away the groceries and decide to make pasta. I preheat the oven to 375 to bake the bread and to keep the chicken hot until my wife gets home. I put some water in a pan and turn the burner on high. When the water starts boiling, I put in the pasta and decide to make a salad. Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, “I’m home!” She comes into the kitchen, and helps with chopping the tomatoes to add to the sauce. She stirs the sauce until it’s done, while I finish tossing the salad.

I get out the place mats and napkins to set the table. I also make sure that there is a spoon, knife, fork, and plate for each of us. About 15 minutes later, we sit down at the table in the dining room and talk about our long day. My wife says she’ll do the dishes, since I cooked, but of course I help out by drying them. First, I put some of the leftovers in a Tupperware container and some in plastic wrap and the rest in aluminum foil. Then I dry the pans, plates, glasses, and silverware.

### 0010 Relaxing, Reading the Mail, and the Trash

With the dinner dishes done, my wife and I each sit down on the couch to chill out and watch the national news which comes on at 6:30. During the newscast, I sort through the day’s mail. Most of it is junk mail and bills. There are also several fliers for houses for sale in the area. I check the front stoop and see that there are no packages.

I like to watch TV and my wife likes to watch reality shows. One thing I hate is having to watch all of the commercials, so I turn the sound down when they come on. After the show is over, I thumb through the latest issue of the Atlantic Monthly, while my wife reads a novel by her favorite mystery writer.

At around 9, I remember that tomorrow is trash day, so I take the kitchen garbage out and dump the recycling bins as well. I roll the trash container out to the street ready for the garbage trucks, which come by early in the morning.

### 0011 Getting Ready for Bed and Going to Sleep

At 10:30, I decide to get ready for bed. When I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story. I’m looking forward to having that ritual with my own kids someday.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the tap. I wash my face, and dry it with my towel. I floss and brush my teeth. I have to admit that by this time, I’m beat, and so is my wife. She cleans up when I’ve finished up.

In the meantime, I walk into the bedroom and get undressed. I put my dirty clothes in the hamper and I put on my pajamas. Wearing my slippers, I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water to put next to the bed in case I need it during the night. I pull back the covers, fluff my pillow, and climb into bed. I set my alarm clock for 6:15, and turn off the overhead light. I lay my head down and pull up the covers, kissing my wife goodnight. Some nights I have trouble falling asleep, but tonight, I didn’t need to count any sheep. I nod off right away and before long, I’m fast asleep.

### 0012 Small Talk About the Weather

I admit that I'm not very good at small talk. When I'm with friends, I can just shoot the breeze all day long. But when I talk to a stranger or someone I don't know very well, I'm always casting about, searching for something to talk about. Politics and religion are definitely taboo subjects, at least here in the United States. But you have to chat about something, otherwise there are these uncomfortable silences.

So we end up talking about - what else? - the weather. This usually begins with something like, "So, nice weather we've been having!" or "It sure is a warm one out there today." Of course, we have to comment on the temperature. My favorite is, "It's not the heat that's so bad, it's the humidity!" Actually, I think that's true - I hate it most when it's muggy outside.

Back in my home state of Minnesota, everyone is obsessed with the weather report! Every TV station has its own meteorologist with a high-tech radar giving you the 5 day forecast. They tell you when the temperature is rising or falling, what kind of clouds are moving in, and how cold the wind chill is.

My favorite quote about the weather comes from Mark Twain, who once said, that everybody talks about the weather, but no one does anything about it!

### 0013 Going to the Drugstore

I stopped by the drugstore last night on my way back home from work. I had a few toiletries to pick up, as well as my prescription. Fortunately, the chain pharmacy where I go has a little bit of everything: food, greeting cards, magazines – it’s almost as big as a regular supermarket.

To begin with, I needed to get some medications for my allergies. I've got hay fever, so I'm sneezing up a storm every morning when I wake up. While I was at it, I also got some antacids and some Band-Aids. Now it was time to pick up my refill.

I stood in line for a few minutes before being waited on. Since it was not a new prescription, the pharmacist didn't have to do a consultation with me. I just gave the clerk my insurance card and she rang up the sale. Fortunately, I have a low co-pay, so my HMO foots most of the bill.

### 0014 Going to the Post Office

For me, things never go very smoothly at the local post office. I've learned that if you want to mail a letter, you'll have no problems. But if things get more complicated than that, well, watch out!

Yesterday I went there to mail a small package and pick up a book of stamps. I wait my turn in line, and when I get up to the window, the clerk says, "What can I do for you?" "Well," I say, "I need a book – no make that a roll – of stamps. And I need to send this package priority to San Francisco." "You want insurance with that?" he asks me. "Uh, I don't know, what do you recommend?" "Well," he says, "you can send it priority with tracking if you want to see when it gets there, you can send it insured if the contents are valuable, or you can do both."

"Okay, I'll take the insurance." "Then step aside to fill out the insurance form," he says, "and bring it back up to me when you're finished." With that, I was waved aside to fill out my form. "Next in line!" the clerk calls. When I finish filling out the form, I wait patiently until the gentleman being waited on in front of me is finished, and then step back up to the window. "Sorry," the clerk says, "I'm on break now. She can help you at the next window."

Maybe it would be quicker just to drive my package to San Francisco.

### 0015 Problems at the Office

Lucy: Hey Jeff, can I pick your brain for a minute?

Jeff: Sure, what's up?

Lucy: Well, I have a sticky situation at work and I wanted to get your input. You're always so tactful.

Jeff: Thanks. I'm not sure I can help but I'll give you my two cents.

Lucy: Well, it's like this. There's this guy I work with who is always making jokes about the boss. Don't get me wrong. I like a good joke now and then, especially about the boss. But, sometimes he goes too far.

Jeff. What do you mean?

Lucy: Well, just the other day, he got a picture off the Internet and cut and pasted the boss's head onto it. Let's just say it was a very unflattering picture of him.

Jeff: Hmm. That's really unprofessional, but it sounds harmless enough, if he kept it to himself or just showed it to a few friends.

Lucy: That's just it. He didn't keep it to himself. He attached the picture to an email and sent it to the entire company, including the top brass.

Jeff: You're joking, right?

Lucy: No, I'm not. This is what I meant when I said he goes too far. He just doesn't know when to quit.

Jeff: Is he a friend of yours?

Lucy: No, not really. But, I don't want the guy to get fired. He's actually a good person. He's just clueless, that's all.

Jeff: Well, that's a tough one. Let me think about it. Maybe there's a way to get him to cut it out before he gets fired.

Lucy: Thanks. I appreciate it.

Jeff: Oh, it's no big deal. Let's go get a bite to eat.

Lucy: Sure. Sounds good to me.

### 0016 Driving on the Freeways

Driving in a big city like L.A. can be very difficult. It sometimes feels like I'm doing battle just to get to the grocery store. What is it about getting behind the wheel that brings out people's aggressive side? The most mild-mannered driver becomes crazy when they get on the road.

In L.A., people rely on the freeway to commute to their jobs or just to get around town. I think driving on the freeway has its good and its bad. On the one hand, there are no stoplights and the speed limit is over 55 miles per hour so you can get somewhere quickly. On the other hand, there are drawbacks, too. People like to gun their engines and cut off other cars to get ahead. If you’re driving in the passing lane, for example, you’d better be driving very fast, since most people are speeding. With all of these speeding cars, it’s not unusual to see a pileup every day of the week!

As an alternate to the freeway, I sometimes take surface streets. Of course, surface streets have their drawbacks, too. If you have a long commute to work or school, it can take you a long time to get there. There are a lot of stop signs, stoplights, and crosswalks. And, people sometimes tailgate if they think you're not going fast enough. Now that I think about it, there's sometimes even more congestion on surface streets than on the freeways!

It’s tough living in L.A. unless you never leave your house!

### 0017 Reading the Newspaper

I fell into the habit of reading the newspaper every morning when I was a kid. Back then, there used to be two daily newspapers – a morning edition and an afternoon edition.

Nowadays, of course, most cities in the U.S. have just a morning paper. I'm not too picky about which newspaper I read, although when it comes to national newspapers, I prefer reading the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal over USA Today.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a news junkie. I just like browsing the different sections, reading the headlines, and checking out the classifieds. I usually skip the sport section and the funnies, and only flip through the food and health sections, but I always read the front page and the editorial page. On the weekends, I'll skim the entertainment section for movie listings and reviews.

I'm sort of old fashioned in that I still like reading a real, paper newspaper. Sure, I also read some of my news online, but nothing beats lounging around on Sunday morning reading the big, thick paper. Don't worry, though: I always recycle my stack of newspapers.

### 0018 Seeing Old Friends

This has been a month for seeing old friends. I got an email a couple of weeks ago from an old friend from college. She and her family are visiting L.A. for a week. They plan to see family and to visit old friends. Since she moved away, I hadn't seen her in ages. I'm looking forward to meeting her new kids and seeing her again.

Another old friend called this week. She and I were buddies when we were young. She plans to swing by L.A. on her way to San Francisco. We've made plans to have lunch. She works in Washington D.C. and is normally very busy. I'm glad she could make time for us to get together.

When we say good-bye to our friends, we always hope to keep in touch. But, what with this and that, it's sometimes hard to do. With friends that I've fallen out of touch with, it's sometimes hard to meet again and pick up where we left off. We've both moved on to a different phase in our lives. Some of my old friends have become very successful, and are living lives in the fast lane. Other friends are having a more difficult time and are just making ends meet. But, no matter how they're doing, it's always nice to touch base again.

I'm really looking forward to seeing these old pals and catching up after all this time. We just won’t mention how much we’ve aged.

### 0019 Tough Negotiations

I'm not what you would call the world's best negotiator, but sometimes it's necessary to engage in a tough negotiation. Take, for instance, the time I had to renew the lease on my apartment. This was back in college, when I was renting a small studio in the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles. When my lease was up, the landlord and I sat down to hammer out the terms of a new lease.

"I'll tell you what I'm going to do," he said. "I'm going to give you a break on rent if you sign a two-year lease instead of just a one-year lease."

"Well," I said, "I don't know. What sort of break are we talking about here?"

"I'll give you a 5% rent increase instead of a 10% increase in exchange for you signing a two-year lease. It's a win-win situation: you get a cut in rent, and I get the security of a two-year lease."

At this point, I decided to make a counter-proposal. "How about this," I said, "You give me a one year lease with a six percent increase."

"No, I can't make that sort of deal," he said. "But here's what I can do, and it's my final offer: I'll pay for your electricity for the first 6 months of the lease, along with the other terms I mentioned before."

"You drive a hard bargain. Okay, it's a deal," I said. I guess I could have tried to bargain him down a bit more, but I was happy with our agreement. Now all I had to do was sign on the dotted line.

### 0020 Formal Emails

Dear Dr. Lee:

I don't know if you'll remember me, but I introduced myself to you after your keynote at last week's conference. As I mentioned to you, I have read all of your work and I am a great admirer of your research. Your article in the top journal Language Learning was groundbreaking.

The reason I am contacting you is that I would like to come to your university to study with you. I met some of your students at the conference and they couldn't stop singing your praises as a professor. I don't know if you are accepting any new students for the next year, but if so, I hope you will consider me.

I have included two attachments to this email. I am sending a copy of my CV, and I am also including a research paper I completed earlier this year. I hope that these will give you an idea of my qualifications and experience. Please let me know if you need more information or more samples of my academic work.

It was a pleasure and a privilege to meet you at the conference, and I hope to hear more about your research at a future conference.

Sincerely,

Lucy Hocevar

### 0021 Getting an Interview

I've finally landed my first interview. Well, actually, that's not really true. I have been on many interviews for part-time jobs. This was my first interview for a full-time job.

In less than two months, I will graduate from Arizona University. After a lot of back and forth trying to decide on a major, I finally decided to double major. I would study both political science and marketing.

These are not majors that usually go together. In fact, most people thought I was crazy. But, after a lot of soul searching, I decided to combine my two main interests: 1. politics and 2. getting a job! Those are my two priorities. I thought that if I got degrees in these two fields, I could cast a wide net when going job hunting. And, that's what I'm trying to do now.

Since I don't know if I want to work in the public or private sector, I've applied for jobs in both. In the public sector, I could work for the government. Maybe one day, I could even be a speech writer for the president! Okay, maybe I should shoot a little lower.

In the private sector, I could work for private organizations such as museums or schools. Some of those are non-profit. I could also work for a company. Everybody tells me that that's where you can make a lot of money. I haven't decided yet. I'm planning to apply for a lot of jobs and will see what happens. What I want now is just to get some job offers. Then, I can start to be picky.

### 0022 Making a Good Impression

My interview is today. It is with a large corporation with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. It also has satellite offices across the U.S. and in Europe. I'm not sure if this will be the right fit for me, but I'm keeping an open mind.

I got some sound advice from my aunt. She said I should be confident but not cocky. That means I have to look for opportunities to talk about myself but not make the mistake of boasting or, worse, making things up. I do that sometimes when I get really nervous. My brain stops working and my mouth keeps going.

I need to be respectful but not meek. I want to be professional with everyone – my co-workers and my bosses – but I don't want them to think that I would let my co-workers walk all over me.

I should show them that I'm a team player. Nobody likes a person who tries to grab the limelight all of the time, especially if they're new, like me.

Okay, I think I'm ready. I just have to remember to be confident, calm, respectful, professional, and a team player. No problem, right?

### 0023 A Visit to the Doctor

Going to the doctor is never particularly pleasant for me. But I couldn’t put it off any longer. It was time for my annual physical, and there was no getting around it. So I picked up the phone and called for an appointment. “I’d like to see Dr. Shimoya next week, please, if that’s possible,” I said. Of course, it wasn’t possible. The doctor was booked until next month, the receptionist told me. “Okay,” I said, “Let’s schedule it for next month.”

When the day arrived, I drove over to the doctor and checked in at the receptionist’s desk. I had to present my HMO card and pay the co-pay of $15.00. The receptionist instructed me to go to waiting room B, down the hall, first door on the right. So I went there and took a seat to wait. And I waited, and waited. Finally, my name was called and I went in to see the doctor. The nurse weighed me, took my temperature and blood pressure, and asked me why I was there. I told her it was time for my yearly checkup. She told me to follow her to the examination room and then to strip down to my underwear.

Now I was sitting on the exam table, half-freezing, waiting for the doctor to show up. Finally, he walked in, looked at my chart, and began his examination. “Breathe,” he said, as he placed the stethoscope on my chest. “Breathe in and out slowly,” he said. I did so. Then he checked my throat and had me lie down to check my abdomen. Finally, he ordered a blood test and said, “Well, you’re good for another year, Mr. McQuillan.”

Thank goodness, I thought to myself, and got dressed to leave.

### 0024 Taking Credit

Jeff: You're not going to believe what happened.

Lucy: Oh, is the big meeting over? What happened?

Jeff: Dan tried to take credit for our idea for the new campaign.

Lucy: You're kidding me! I thought he might try to pull something like this, but I didn't think he'd have the nerve to do that.

Jeff: Yeah, and to top it off, he said that he did it all by himself.

Lucy: He's unbelievable. What a jerk! He slacks off for the last two weeks and doesn't lift a finger to help on any part of the project.

Jeff: Well, he's not going to get away with it. I'm going to talk to the senior vice president. I think she'll listen.

Lucy: Are you sure? I think she's fair-minded, but maybe she thinks we should work it out with Dan ourselves. She might not want to step in.

Jeff: Well, can you think of another way to handle this?

Lucy: I wish I could. I don't want to just blow it off, but we have to think of the fallout. Maybe the senior VP will end up thinking we can't fight our own battles.

Jeff: Yeah, you're right. I'm just so ticked off right now I can't think.

Lucy: That's probably the problem. We both need to cool off so we can think straight. Let's get some coffee and see what we can come up with.

Jeff: That sounds good. But if I see Dan on the way out, I'm going to floor that guy.

Lucy: Yeah. That makes two of us.

### 0025 A Trip to New York City

(The phone rings.)

Lucy: Hello.

Jeff: Hey, Lucy, it's Jeff.

Lucy: Hey, welcome back. How was your vacation?

Jeff: Oh, it was great. The seven days in New York were a blast.

Lucy: Oh, yeah? Did you do any sightseeing or just visit with friends?

Jeff: I got to do both, actually. First, I saw my friend Edmundo, who just moved there. He hadn't seen much of the city himself, so we went to all the tourist spots. We got a guidebook and went to the major museums, saw a play, went to a concert in Central Park, and took the Staten Island Ferry. We did all of that in a day and a half. It was a whirlwind, but we got to see a lot.

Lucy: A day and a half?! You guys must have been exhausted.

Jeff: Yeah, we were. But, the rest of my trip was pretty low-key. My friends Pat and Billie rented a car and we took a road trip to Upstate New York to visit some other friends of ours.

Lucy: Did you have to stay over in a hotel along the way, or did you drive straight through?

Jeff: We didn't bother with booking hotel rooms, so we just drove straight there. It wasn't that far.

Lucy: How long did you stay there?

Jeff: We were only there two days, and we drove back and got back last night. My flight was this morning at 8:00 a.m. The worst part of the whole trip was that my flight was cancelled. I was rebooked onto another flight that had a three-hour layover in Chicago. That was a major pain.

Lucy: It sounds like it. Well, I'm glad you made it back okay. And you even have the weekend to rest up before work on Monday.

Jeff: Yeah, I'll need it. I've got to catch up on my sleep!

### 0026 At the Movies

My friend Jim and I decided to see the latest blockbuster this weekend. I like a good action movie once in a while. We decided to meet at the movie theater after work.

When I got to the theater, I looked around and didn't see Jim. So, I thought I would get in line to buy tickets. There were two different lines, so I asked a woman standing in the first one, "Is this the line for Mission Impossible 4?" She said, "Yes, I'm afraid it is." I turned around and saw why she said that. The line was really long and had about 20 people in it already. Oh, well. I went to the back of the line and waited.

About 10 minutes later, I saw Jim coming up the escalator. When he got off the escalator, he looked out of breath. He said, "Hey, sorry for being so late. I hit a lot of traffic on the way over." I told him, "Don't worry about it. As you can see, we have a long wait."

We finally got to the head of the line and walked up to the ticket window. The clerk behind the ticket window asked, "Can I help you?" I said, "Two tickets for MI-4, please." We weren't children, students, or seniors, so there were no special discounts for us. The clerk handed me two tickets and we headed inside. There was a ticket taker just inside the door. He took our tickets and handed back our stubs.

Coming straight from work, I was really hungry. Jim and I went to the concession stand and got a couple of Cokes, hot dogs, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. We were set. We went into the screening room and it was packed. Luckily for us, we found some seats together that weren't too close to the screen.

We sat back and waited for the movie to start. While we watched 10 minutes of previews, we wolfed down our food. By the time the movie started, I was feeling pretty good. I don't know which was better, the movie or the great junk food!

### 0027 Car Trouble

I was driving down the Santa Monica Freeway yesterday, headed toward downtown, when all of a sudden I saw my engine light come on. Needless to say, that's not the sort of thing one likes to see. So, I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and parked on the shoulder. I popped the hood and looked to see what the problem might be. I'm no mechanic – I barely know how to check the oil and the wiper fluid – but perhaps something would jump out at me.

The car didn't overheat, since there was no steam coming out of the radiator. I checked the battery cables, and the battery was definitely not dead. I didn't know quite what else to do, so I pulled out my cell phone and called AAA for a tow to the nearest repair shop. I started worrying about all the things it could be: the fuel pump, the transmission, the electrical system. Who knows? I just had new brakes put in a month ago, so I knew it couldn't be that.

The tow truck finally arrived and we went to a nearby mechanic. He checked everything and then told me that he had found the problem: the engine light sensor was broken! I now had to take it to the dealer to get it fixed. Well, at least it didn't end up costing me an arm and a leg.

### 0028 Cashing a Check

The local branch of my bank is located just a few blocks from where I live. It's very convenient, since it has four ATMs open 24/7. Today I had to go make a deposit, but because I wanted to cash a check as well, I needed to go inside to talk to a teller.

Inside the bank, I got in line for the tellers. All of the tellers are behind a large piece of bulletproof glass, so you have to speak up when you are talking to them. When I got to the head of the line, the cashier asked, "How may I help you?" I said, "I'd like to deposit this payroll check into my checking account and cash this cashier's check." "Certainly," she said, "just endorse the back of both checks and put them in the tray." I said, "Sure. And can I get that in small bills – tens and twenties?"

I waited for her to process my checks. Then she said, "Here you are," and counted out the cash and put it in an envelope. "Thank you," I said, and walked away. Now that I have some money burning a hole in my pocket, I guess I’d better spend it!

### 0029 Staying In

It was Friday night, and my roommate and I felt like staying in. We both had had a tough week at work and decided to have a low-key evening. On my way home, I stopped at the video rental store and rented a couple of movies. I got a new release and a classic. I thought I had left my membership card at home, but I found it at the last minute. I like going to my local rental store because it doesn't charge late fees. That's handy when I don't have time to return the DVDs the next day.

My roommate and I were feeling too tired to go out to eat, so we decided to order in. We mulled over the take-out menus from restaurants that had delivery service, but couldn't decide which restaurant to order from. The trouble was that we had never eaten at the two restaurants nearby. Ordering from either one would be a crapshoot. In the end, we decided to just order a pizza. I called the restaurant and placed our delivery order.

About a half hour later, the delivery person came to the door. I asked him if I could pay with a credit card, and he said, "Sure." I handed him my card and he wrote down the number. I signed the slip and added a tip to the total. He gave me a copy of the slip as a receipt and then handed me the pizza. I was really glad to get it; I was starving.

With our movies and the pizza, we were all set. There's nothing like a night at home, vegging out to get over a hectic week.

### 0030 At the Art Exhibit

I really wanted to see the new exhibit at the art museum, and I invited Lucy to come along. We both like contemporary art, and this was an exhibition by an artist we've both liked ever since she was up-and-coming 10 years ago.

This exhibit was a retrospective, so there was going to be a lot of different types of work by the artist. There would be some of the artist's paintings, her early work. There would also be some of her sculptures. Her most recent work is mixed-media. She is very versatile, and that's one of the reasons I like her work so much.

We were going to the opening of the exhibition, with a wine and cheese reception for the artist. When we arrived in the main gallery, there were already a lot of people there. Looking around, I could see that some of the people were artists themselves and others were art critics. I'm sure there were collectors there, too. I knew the curator and looked around for him. I spotted him talking with a group of people in the corner.

After a little while, the curator said a few words and then introduced the artist. We got a chance to meet her briefly and she was very gracious. I'm glad that someone with her talent has made it in the art world. That's not easy to do. And I think her best work is still to come.

### 0031 Getting Up

On a weekday, I usually get up around 6:30 a.m., but I set my alarm to go off at 6:20 so that I can hit the snooze button to sleep another 10 minutes. My roommate thinks I’m crazy, but doing this in the mornings actually helps me wake up. I’m a night owl, not an early bird like she is, so I need an extra few minutes to get going in the morning.

One reason it’s so hard to get up is because my bedroom and my bed are so comfortable. I splurged and bought a bed with a very soft, thick mattress. I also have matching sheets and pillowcases, and a comforter that is made of goose down. Even my nightstand matches my sheets and the rest of my bedroom. I decorated it so that it would be restful after a busy day at work.

When I get up, the first thing I do is put on my robe. It’s always so cold in the apartment in the mornings, no matter what time of year it is. Then, I usually make my bed. I hated making my bed when I was little, but now it’s become a routine. Sometimes, though, I’m so tired that I sleep in for just a little too long and then, the bed definitely doesn’t get made. On those days, I wish I could sleep in all day!

### 0032 Cleaning Up and Putting on Make-Up

I share a bathroom with my roommate, which is usually not a problem. We each try to keep the sink, the tub, and the toilet clean, and we have separate medicine cabinets to keep our things. There’s also room under the sink for our hairdryers and tampons.

I start out by rinsing my mouth with some mouthwash before flossing. Then, I take out my toothbrush and toothpaste and brush my teeth. I only wash my hair every other day so I put on a shower cap and don’t have to get out my shampoo and conditioner. I like to take bubble baths when I have time, but on a busy morning, a shower will have to do. I lather up quickly and give my legs a quick shave.

I don’t wear a lot of make-up to work so I just put on a little blush and a light-colored lipstick, and skip the mascara and eye shadow. I put a few hot curlers in my hair and I’m ready for breakfast!

### 0033 Eating Breakfast

In the kitchen, the first thing I do is pour myself a cup of coffee and I add a little skim milk and sugar. My roommate usually makes a pot when she wakes up for both of us since she gets up first.

I go the fridge to take out the eggs. When I have time, I like to cook a hot breakfast, so I take out the frying pan, pour a little oil in it, and turn on the front burner on the stovetop. While the eggs are cooking, I put two pieces of bread into the toaster. When the eggs are nice and brown on the edges, I use a spatula to put them on a plate. Some mornings, I have to settle for some cold cereal or just toast with jam, but it’s nice to start the day with a sit-down meal when I get the chance.

When I’m done, I take my plate and my silverware to the sink, where my roommate has left her breakfast dishes. Since she makes the coffee in the morning, I wash the dishes. It’s a pretty good arrangement. I put a little dishwashing detergent on the sponge, scrub the dishes, and leave them in the drying rack to dry.

### 0034 Doing Hair

I go back into the bathroom to finish doing my hair. Before I put the hot curlers in, I had put a little gel in my hair to give it some volume. I also like to use my hairdryer to give my bangs a little more shape. I take out the curlers one by one and brush through them into the style I like. I finish it off with a little hairspray and I’m ready to get dressed.

In my bedroom, I look in my closet for a skirt and blouse to match. The office I work in is pretty casual so I don’t need to wear a suit to work. On Fridays, we’re allowed to be even more casual so most people wear jeans and sweaters to the office, but no one dares to show up in t-shirts and shorts. I put on the skirt and blouse and open the top dresser drawer to get some pantyhose. I wish I could wear my tennis shoes to work, but I pick out a pair of heels and put them on. I was ready to go.

### 0035 Taking Public Transportation

I like my job but it takes over an hour to get there from my part of town. First, I walk three blocks to the subway station and swipe my monthly pass to get through the turnstile. I wait on the platform for the first express train. I get on and since it’s so crowded during the morning hours, there aren’t any seats and I stand, holding onto a handrail. At my stop, I get off and transfer to a second train that will get me to Union Station. This one isn’t as crowded and I manage to find a seat.

When the train gets to Union Station, I get off the train, go up the stairs, and go out of the front exit to the bus stop. I get on the B bus to downtown and show my bus pass to the bus driver. I sit down near the front of the bus and when three more people get on board, the driver starts on the route. When we get close to my stop, I press the button to signal to the driver that I need to get off and the bus pulls up to the next stop. I get off and walk half a block to the building where I work. It’s a long commute, but I look around every morning and I see that I’m not the only one who has to do it.

### 0036 At My Desk

I get to the office and sit down at my desk. I share a cubicle with another employee, Jim, but he only works in the afternoons so we don’t usually get in each other’s way too much. I boot up my computer and look at my agenda for today. I had about 30 new emails in my inbox but I decide not to read them right away. There were some new inter-office paperwork in my inbox too, but I decide to look at them a little later. First, I wanted to start in on a report that I had to finish today. I had a conference call at the end of the day with the head office, but I had most of the day to get it done.

Before long, it was the lunch hour. I didn’t pack a lunch so I ask my supervisor if she wanted to have lunch together. We head down the street to a sit-down restaurant. The hostess shows us to a table in the back of the restaurant. The waiter arrives a few minutes later and we order entrees, no appetizers, since we need to get back by 1:00. The waiter was very busy so I had to wave him down to get the check. He brought the bill, and my supervisor and I split the check. We walk back to the office and I get back to work. Just four more hours until quitting time!

### 0037 Bank and Market

I left work at exactly five o’clock because I wanted to make it to the bank before it closed at 5:30. Fortunately, it’s on the way to the bus stop. I get to the bank and I stand in line. I fill out a deposit envelope and sign the back of my paycheck while I wait my turn. When I get to the front of the line, I hand the teller the envelope and I ask her if she could tell how much I had in my account. She told me my balance and handed me my receipt.

I ride the bus and the subway home. I realize that I need a few things at the market and stop at one on the way there. I pick up a cart as soon as I walk in and go to the produce department to load up on fruit, some apples and bananas. I look around to see what kind of cooked foods they have. I’m feeling lazy and I don’t want to cook tonight. I pick up a sandwich and I head for the checkout stands. I get into the shortest line and the cashier rings me up. She gives me my change and the bagger hands me my bags. I walk the two blocks to my apartment and I’m ready for a relaxing evening at home.

### 0038 Dinner and Making Dessert

When I get home, I change into my casual clothes and head for the kitchen. I grab my sandwich, a napkin, and sit down at the dining room table to eat. For my birthday last year, my brother gave me some place mats that have maps of the United States on them. I have always been bad at geography so he thought he would be funny and give me something to study while I ate. Of course, I haven’t learned a thing!

I am still hungry after the sandwich and want some dessert. I preheat the oven and then take a package of ready-made cookies out of the fridge that just needed to be baked. I get out a cookie sheet and put some aluminum foil on it. I always do this when I bake because this way, I don’t have to do any dishes afterwards. I could just throw away the foil. Then, I shape the dough into circles, put them on the cookie sheet, and put the pan into the oven.

After 15 minutes, I put on my oven mitts and take the pan out. The cookies smell great, but first, I need to let them cool. After 30 minutes, I put three of them on a plate and the rest of them in a Tupperware container. I’ll take those to work tomorrow. That should make the day go by a little faster.

### 0039 Cleaning and Relaxing

I am feeling pretty energetic when I finish my three cookies and decide to do a little cleaning. I take out a rag and start dusting the living room. I dust the TV and the lamps. I wipe the coffee table, too. The rug looked filthy so I get out the vacuum and vacuum it. I pick up around the room and put things away. The bathroom needs cleaning, too, but by this time, I am starting to feel tired. Mopping the bathroom floor and scrubbing the tub will have to wait for another day.

I turn on the TV to watch the newscast, but I missed the national news. I flip through the channels but all I see are commercials. My favorite reality show doesn’t come on for another hour so I turn off the TV. I put down the remote, and pick up a magazine. I thumb through it for few minutes and then the phone rings. It’s my best friend Marlene, so I put down the magazine and spend the half hour chatting with her. There’s nothing like a good talk with a good friend to end a busy day.

### 0040 Getting Ready for Bed and Going to Sleep

I am feeling pretty tired by 11:00 and decide to get ready for bed. I go into the bathroom to take off my make-up. I use a cleanser to wash my face and dry it with a towel. Then I put some toner on my face and then some moisturizer. I comb my hair and tie it back. I don’t like getting hair in my face while I sleep so tying it back helps. I floss and brush my teeth, and am ready for bed. By this time, I am pretty beat.

I go into my bedroom and I get undressed. I put the dirty clothes in the hamper and put on my pajamas. I take off my slippers and pull back the covers. I check my alarm to make sure it’s on. I have this same ritual every night, which I think helps me fall asleep more easily. It’s not long before I’m fast asleep.

### 0041 Understanding Men and Women

Lucy: Jeff, here's a question. I was just talking to Dawn. You know, they had their first wedding anniversary last week. Guess what her husband gave her as a present.

Jeff: I don't know. What?

Lucy: He gave her a vacuum cleaner.

Jeff: Didn't she want a vacuum cleaner?

Lucy: Yes, the old one was broken, but that's not the point! It was their wedding anniversary, their first one. Dawn was really upset that he wasn't more romantic. He really let her down.

Jeff: Oh, great. Women are always saying that men aren't romantic. But we are! Just not in the way that women want.

Lucy: What do you mean?

Jeff: It's a man's job to protect his wife and family. When something goes wrong, they want to fix it. That's the mark of a good husband.

Lucy: I can see that, but that's not romantic in my book.

Jeff: That's because you women have this idealized view of romance that you get from a lifetime of watching chick flicks and reading romance novels. Even if a man wanted to, he could never get into the head of a woman and guess what she wanted. That's why women have to just tell us what they want.

Lucy: That's the problem. We women think men should just know what we want, without us having to tell them; that is, if the man really loved and understood us. That's why we don't want to tell you. But I see your point, too.

Jeff: So, I guess it's really true. Men are from Mars and women are from Venus.

Lucy: Yeah, that's what makes life interesting, right?

### 0042 Talking to a Professor

[A knock on the door.]

Jeff: Come in.

Julie: Hi, Dr. McQuillan, I'm Julie Taylor. I'm in your two o'clock class on Thursdays.

Jeff: Hi, Julie. Have a seat. What can I do for you?

Julie: I wanted to come see you during your office hours because I missed class last week. I had a family emergency.

Jeff: I'm sorry to hear that. We went over a lot of material, so make sure you get the notes from another student in class.

Julie: Thanks, I will. Did you give any assignments?

Jeff: Yes, I assigned an essay on the topics in chapter three of your textbook.

Julie: Oh, I see. Are there guidelines for the essay?

Jeff: Yes, it should be 8 to 10 pages, and it's due in two weeks. Take a look at your syllabus. It has more details.

Julie: I will. Thanks a lot. I've also been meaning to talk to you about the trouble I'm having keeping up in class. I'm having trouble understanding the lectures. Is there anything you would suggest?

Jeff: Some students tape-record the lectures and listen to them afterwards. That seems to help.

Julie: That's a great idea. I'll definitely try that. I'm wondering if you give extra credit in your class.

Jeff: No, I don't give extra credit assignments. But if you're worried about passing, there are still two more tests to pull up your grade.

Julie: Yes, I'll study hard for those. Thanks a lot for your time.

Jeff: No problem. See you in class.

Julie: Okay, Professor McQuillan. See you Thursday.

### 0043 A Trip to the Library

I read in the local paper that a new public library had just opened two weeks ago in my neighborhood. I wanted to check it out. But first, I called the library to check the hours of operation. The librarian told me that they were open Monday through Saturday from 10 to 6, so I decided to see the new library for myself.

I parked my car in the library parking lot and walked in. There were two library clerks behind the counter and a librarian at the reference desk. I walked around and spotted the nonfiction section and moved on to the fiction stacks. There was a pretty good collection in both of these areas. I wanted to see if they had a book I've been wanting to read. So, I went over to the computer to check the online catalog. As it turns out, they had one copy and it had not been checked out. I wrote down the call number and went to the stacks. I found it right away.

When I walked in, I also noticed that the library had music CDs, videos, and DVDs that could be checked out. I looked briefly at the collection but decided not to check out any right then.

I had my book and I was all set. I stood in line and waited to check my book out. The library clerk said, "Next please," and I stepped up to the counter. I asked her what the loan period was for the book. She told me that the due date was three weeks from today. I gave her my library card. She scanned the bar code on my book and stamped the due date on the back of it. It was quick and easy. I was so glad to have a nice new library so close to home.

### 0044 Hiring for a Job

Last week, my administrative assistant gave notice that he was quitting in two weeks. It couldn't have come at a worse time. It was a very busy time of year, but there was nothing I could do. Right away, we put a want ad in the classifieds and received several applications for the job. I called in four of them for interviews, and I had narrowed it down to two candidates.

The first was Claudia Trujillo. From her résumé, I knew that she had had four years of experience working at a telecommunications company. She looked promising, and when she arrived for the interview, she was dressed professionally and seemed personable. When I asked her about her experience, she answered my questions with confidence. She sounded like a hard worker and showed a lot of perseverance. The only drawbacks were that she was a little chatty and she also seemed a little disorganized.

The second candidate was Alex Mayhew. Alex had more experience than Claudia, but in different capacities, and only had one year of experience as an administrative assistant. When I met Alex, he seemed a little rough around the edges. He was earnest and eager but didn't have the air of someone who had worked in a corporate environment. Still, he seemed bright and easy to get along with. He did strike me as being a little shy, but I think that was because he was nervous.

So, those are my two options. Now, which one should I hire? I need to give it some more thought.

### 0045 A Camping Trip

My friends and I decided to take a trip to Yosemite National Park to do some camping and hiking. We all like the outdoors, but we all live in the city. We have all been griping about feeling cooped up, so we decided to take a road trip. This trip would give all of us a break from the traffic, noise, and smog that we all deal with in L.A.

Before we left, I went to the sporting goods store to get some new gear and equipment. I had a tent, but I needed a new sleeping bag, one that was waterproof. I also needed some new hiking boots. Lucky for me, I found everything in one stop, and by the time I left the store, I was really psyched about the trip.

Early on Saturday morning, my friend Rachel came to pick me up. None of us had a camper, but Rachel had an SUV that fit all of us comfortably. I was the last one to be picked up, and I put my backpack and other gear in the trunk. I was about to get into the car when I realized I had left my sunscreen in the house. I rushed back in and grabbed it, and then we were off. I couldn't wait to get some fresh air and plenty of exercise. Yosemite, here we come!

### 0046 Getting Ready to Go

I guess I'm just like everybody else. I could do without Mondays. On the weekend, I can kick back and relax, but I dread going back to work when the weekend is over.

This morning was particularly hectic. On weeknights, I set my alarm for seven a.m. That's what I did last night. But when I woke up this morning and looked at my alarm clock, it was seven thirty! The alarm clock was on the fritz and it didn't go off. Oh no, I was going to be late again.

I washed my face, put on my makeup, got dressed, and ate a small bowl of cereal. I had one foot out the door when I realized I didn't have my keys. I went back into my bedroom and looked on the shelf where I kept them. No luck. Maybe I left them in my purse. I hunted around for them. Finally, I just dumped out everything from my purse onto my bed. I had my wallet, sunglasses, compact, lipstick, eye drops, aspirin, and tissues. But no keys.

I looked around the living room. Maybe they fell behind the couch cushions. I picked up each one and looked. No keys. I went into my closet and checked the pockets of my coat. Still, no keys. By this time, I was pretty frantic, so I tried to calm myself down. I decided to get a drink of water. I opened the refrigerator and what did I see? My keys. They were sitting on the shelf right next to the milk. I must have left them there when I got the milk for my cereal. It served me right for being so absentminded.

Oh, how I hate Monday mornings!

### 0047 Teamwork

Jeff: So, does that sound okay with you?

Lucy: What? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear what you said.

Jeff: You seem preoccupied today. What's up?

Lucy: Oh, it's this guy I know from this class I'm taking. His name is Richard. I think I've mentioned him before.

Jeff: Yeah, sure, the guy you're working on a project with, right?

Lucy: Yeah, that's him. The four of us are supposed to be working as a team on this project, and I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with him.

Jeff: What do you mean?

Lucy: Well, he doesn't know how to express his opinion without putting other people down. And, he always has to be right.

Jeff: He sounds a little immature.

Lucy: Yeah, I think it's partly that. He doesn't know how to be diplomatic with people.

Jeff: He doesn't know how, or he doesn't want to?

Lucy: I don't know, but I do know that sometimes he really gets the better of me.

Jeff: Well, he sounds pretty hard to get along with. Are the other people in your group feeling the same way?

Lucy: Yeah, in fact, they're fed up with him. I keep having to run interference when our discussions get too heated. Actually, I feel really sorry for the guy. He doesn't seem to have too many friends, and he always seems so unhappy.

Jeff: Well, I think you're helping just by putting up with him.

Lucy: Thanks for trying to make me feel better. Ok, now what were you saying?

### 0048 Getting a Haircut

I have an appointment with my hairdresser today. It has been too long since I had my hair cut. My bangs were too long. I had split ends and my roots were showing. I was a mess!

I arrived for my appointment, and I told the receptionist that I was there for an appointment with Mark. She told me that he was finishing up with another client and that he would be with me soon. About 10 minutes later, he came over to where I was sitting and took me back to his station.

Mark: Hi, how have you been? You're looking good.

Lucy: Thanks. I've been great. Thanks for fitting me in today.

Mark: No problem. So, tell me, what do you want to have done today?

Lucy: I need a trim.

Mark: Okay. Let's see, how short do you want me to cut it? Shoulder length? Chin length?

Lucy: I'd like to take it up about two inches in the back, and the bangs should fall just under my eyebrows.

Mark: Okay, I really think that's a good length for your face shape.

Just as I had hoped, Mark did a great job with my hair. I paid the receptionist and made sure I gave him a big tip. Anyone who can do wonders with my crazy hair definitely deserves it!

### 0049 Preparing a Paper (for School)

Student: I wonder if I could ask you some questions about our paper, Professor. Do you want us to cite our sources in the footnotes?

Professor: You should use endnotes for longer explanations. Otherwise, just follow the style sheet I passed out for citations in your paper.

Student: I see. And what about the cover page? Is there a special format for that as well?

Professor: Do you have the handout I passed out with you? If you look at the bottom of that, you'll see that you should follow the format of the American Psychological Association, fifth edition.

Student: Okay, I guess I missed that.

### 0050 Reading Magazines

I'm the first to admit that I'm hooked on reading magazines. I've been this way as long as I can remember. I love picking up magazines about different topics. Currently, I subscribe to about six or seven magazines, although when I was getting professional journals during my days at the university, I probably had 15 or 20 coming to my box every month.

Now I read mostly for pleasure. I like to read The New Yorker because it is so well written. I also get a copy of Atlantic Monthly and Harper’s every month because they have good coverage of cultural, political, and social issues. My latest is to read book reviews. There are a couple of really good book reviews published in the U.S., including The New York Review of Books.

But the best reviews for my money are The Times Literary Supplement and the London Review of Books, both of which come out of England. I have to thank my friend Gustavo for turning me on to those two. I prefer to read the nonfiction reviews over the fiction ones, but that's me. Ah, the joys of reading!

### 0051 Eating Fast Food

My friend Julia called me the other day. She wanted to grab some lunch and asked me if I wanted to go to the local fast food place down the street. I said sure, even though I knew it wouldn't be good for me. I hopped in my car and swung by to pick her up at her work. When we got to the restaurant, there was already a long line at the drive-through. It was the lunch hour, so that is to be expected.

We inched forward in the driveway and finally reached the order station. "Welcome to McApple's Restaurant. How can I help you today?" I leaned over to shout into the little box, "Uh, I'll have a cheeseburger, and my friend will take a regular hamburger." "Would you like anything to drink with that?" she asked. She had a very low voice. "Two Diet Cokes, please," I said. "And would you like any fries with that?" she asked again. "No, just the hamburgers, thanks." "That'll be $8.75. Please pull forward."

We drove up to the pick-up window and paid the cashier. Our food was ready about 30 seconds later. "Thank you!" I said as we drove away. We pulled over to the side of the road to eat our hamburgers. I knew I was going to regret it, but it sure did taste good!

### 0052 Preparing for a Business Trip

I'm going to a conference this weekend back in my home state of Minnesota. I am going there to address a convention full of librarians, believe it or not. For me, the worst part of going on the road for business is not the traveling; it's all the preparation you have to do. I created a whole checklist of things I have to do when I travel.

First, I confirm that my flight will be on time departing from LAX. Next, I call to double-check on my reservation for the hotel and the rent-a-car. After that, I pull out my suitcase and start packing. I'm a light packer, so I bring only the pants, shirts, socks, and underwear I'm going to need, nothing more. I throw in my toiletries bag with the usual stuff – shaver, shaving cream, toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss – and then I'm just about done.

Finally, I go through my briefcase to make sure I have all the things I'll need for the conference: my badge, my laptop, my overhead transparencies, a notepad, and some pens. Now I'm ready. Off I go to my old home.

### 0053 Picking a Wardrobe

I'm one of those people who don't have much of a fashion sense. I mean, I know that I shouldn't wear a pink shirt with green pants, but beyond that I'm pretty much a basket case when it comes to picking my wardrobe.

I have plenty of short-sleeve and long-sleeve dress shirts; some have a button-down collar and some have a shirt pocket in them. I also own some more casual shirts with a collar, and a ton of T-shirts with just about every logo you can think of. I have a couple of good pairs of black slacks for formal occasions, along with khakis and jeans for more informal events.

Naturally, I have one nice suit to wear to weddings, funerals, and job interviews, with a suit coat, tie, a belt with a nice-looking buckle, and pants. I also own a sports coat, but I don't use it much. Well, I better stop talking and start dressing. I'm late for work!

### 0054 A Trip to the Jewelry Store

My wife's birthday was coming up and I wanted to get her a special present. She always tells me not to splurge on gifts for her, but for once, I decided to pull out all the stops.

I went to the jewelry store and began looking at all of the display cases. I started by looking at the bracelets. The sales clerk asked me if I was looking for a bangle or a chain bracelet. I told her that I wasn't sure, and she showed me some in yellow gold, white gold, and platinum. None of them seemed like my wife's style, so I moved on to the rings.

The clerk asked me if my wife liked diamonds, and I told her that she did but that she also liked other stones, like emeralds, rubies, or sapphires. I looked at a lot of anniversary bands, but none really fit the bill.

Finally, I walked over to the display case with the necklaces. There was a pearl necklace with a really beautiful clasp. I had never seen anything like it before and I was sure my wife was going to like it. I told the clerk that I would take it.

The clerk placed the necklace in its box and gift wrapped it. I have to say that when I left the store, I felt pretty proud of myself. I knew my wife would like the present, and I picked it out all by myself. Now, I can't wait to see the look on her face when she opens it!

### 0055 A Family Party

I visit my hometown about once a year. This year, I was in town for about five days and there was a family get-together. It wasn't a family reunion since it was just my immediate family, but still, there was a total of about 45 people who showed up.

Our family parties are always held at the home of one of my brothers or sisters. It is always a potluck. We never have formal dinner parties so we never need catering. At the potluck this past weekend, some people brought casseroles, some brought chips and dip, and some brought cookies and cakes for dessert. I usually don't have to bring anything since I'm the guest of honor.

There is always a lot of talking and laughing at our family parties. Someone always brings up old childhood memories or a funny anecdote from the old days. A family get-together as big as ours can be overwhelming for some people. When they ask me what it's like to be part of such a big family, I always tell them one thing: It's noisy!

### 0056 Noisy Neighbors

I live in a quiet neighborhood. At least that's what I thought until last week.

I live in a cul-de-sac in a residential neighborhood in Los Angeles. There is a nice retired couple that lives kitty-corner from me. They have always been very friendly and we have gotten along very well.

About three months ago, they decided to renovate their garage and turn it into a guesthouse. Since they don’t have a lot of money, they wanted to rent out the unit to help make ends meet.

A new renter moved in about three weeks ago, and that's when the trouble began. She was a student at the local university and she liked to invite her friends over. The trouble was they kept very late hours, and they liked to play loud music. My neighbors were at their wits' end. They talked to their tenant several times about the noise, but nothing worked. Finally, they asked her to move out. Fortunately, she was on a month-to-month lease and they didn't have any problems.

Now that my neighbors have learned their lesson, their new tenant is a nice widow with two cats. I'm so glad that everything worked out in the end!

### 0057 Making a Presentation

I don't normally get stage fright, but the thought of getting up in front of my colleagues to give a presentation always gives me butterflies. But I have no choice; my boss asked me to do it, so I will.

I set up my projector and PowerPoint program on my laptop. Clearing my voice, I stood up and addressed the 10 people present at the meeting. I started off by saying, "Good afternoon. I want to thank you for inviting me to talk to you today." I had a clicker in my hand to advance the slides. "Today I'm going to talk to you about our new product, Provasic. Please feel free to ask questions as we go along," I said.

I then flipped through the slides showing pictures of our product, and concluded by summarizing the main points of my talk with bullet points. I finished by saying, "Thank you for your attention today. My contact information is on your handout." Whew! I was glad that was over!

### 0058 Having Car Trouble

As I was driving home from work, my car started acting up. It was making a strange noise and the engine was running roughly. When I got home, I popped open the hood to see if there was anything wrong. After looking around for a few minutes and not seeing anything, I decided to take my car to the shop.

I took it down to street to Manny's Car Repair. I've never had luck finding a really honest mechanic, but Manny was no worse than most. I explained to Manny the problem and he took a look at it right away. Finally, he narrowed it down to the fan belt. I asked him how much it would set me back, and he said $80 with parts and labor.

I usually feel like I'm getting ripped off when I go to a repair shop, but for once, I thought Manny was being straight with me. I asked how long he needed to keep the car, and he said at least until the end of the day tomorrow. He said he would order the part right away and he’d call me when it was ready.

Oh, well. I guess it could have been a lot worse. I better dust off my bike to take to work tomorrow. It's about time I got some exercise!

### 0059 Opening a Bank Account

I decided to switch banks recently, and after looking at my options, I went for Mar Vista National Bank. I drove over to the bank, parked next to the drive-through teller lanes, and walked inside.

I made my way to the new accounts desk and was greeted by John, one of the customer service representatives there. I told him I wanted to open a new checking and savings account. He said he’d be happy to help me, and gave me a form to fill out with my personal information, including place of employment, home address, and so forth. I had to show him a government-issued ID and give him my Social Security number.

John asked if I wanted an interest-bearing account with overdraft protection. Technically, he said, the savings account is a money market where I can earn interest daily. The checking was free if I had direct deposit, and my checks were also free.

I signed on the dotted line, gave him the minimum deposit to open the account, and thanked him for his help. I'm glad I got that out of the way. Now all I need to do is make some money to put into my accounts!

### 0060 Calling Tech Support

I recently signed up for a new ISP for my office, using DSL. I managed to get the modem and the router configured properly, but now my email won't work. I dug out the manual that came with the modem and called the toll-free line for technical support. I'm not a big fan of most IT departments, but if something doesn't work, they're the only game in town.

I explained to the tech support person that I couldn't get my email to send or receive. He asked me if I had checked the Ethernet connection from the modem to the router, and I said I did. Then he asked if I had run any diagnostics on the email software and if I was able to connect to the web. I said no to both of these questions.

He told me he would submit a ticket and have the problem escalated to the next level. Someone should be calling me back, he said. I won’t hold my breath.

### 0061 Missing Person, Part 1: ＂The Man in the Mask.＂

I didn’t kill him.

I didn’t even plan to kill him. I had a gun, but I just wanted to hurt him and stop him from attacking me. I had no idea why this stranger was hitting me, and it was ticking me off.

This morning Anne Prado, one of my students at the University of Southwestern California, came to my office. She said she had a problem and she needed my help. Her sister, Sarah, was missing. We were on our way to Sarah's apartment to find her when, halfway up the front steps of the building, a man ran toward me and started punching me.

I hit the man in the ear. He screamed with pain. He was small, but a tough son-of-a-gun. I stepped back and hit him hard in the stomach.

“Oh my God!” he moaned. I think I hurt him that time.

I knew he was in pain. I pushed him down to the ground. He fell onto the grass in front of the steps to the apartment building. Now it was my turn to take control.

I stood over him and asked, “Who are you? What do you want?” He didn’t answer. He had a ski mask on, so I couldn’t see his face.

“Just get the hell away from this apartment building! You’re not welcome here!” he said.

I grabbed him by the shirt, pushed his face into the ground, and twisted his arm behind his back. He yelled even louder now. I think he was finally ready to stop fighting.

“Now, who are you? Why can’t I go inside the apartment?” I was getting angry and wanted some answers. I saw a few people come out of the apartment building to see what was happening.

But the man still didn’t say a word. He lifted himself up suddenly and pushed me away. He looked at me coldly for a second, then ran into the street.

I turned to find Anne to make sure she was okay. “Do you know who he was? Have you seen him before?” I asked.

“No, Dr. Reeves. I don’t come to my sister’s apartment very often. I don’t know who he is.”

Let me back up a minute: This morning in my office, Anne had explained that two days ago she was supposed to have lunch with her sister, Sarah Salas. When her sister didn’t come to the restaurant, Anne called Sarah’s apartment. There was no answer.

Anne went to her sister’s apartment right away and knocked on the door, but there was no one home. She called Sarah’s work. Sarah’s boss told Anne that Sarah had been missing for two days. So Anne decided to ask me to help find her sister and her sister’s husband, Bill, who was also missing.

### 0062 Missing Person, Part 2: “Beer and Cigarettes.”

Some of my students know I’m an amateur detective. Before I became a university professor five years ago, I had a real job. I worked for a security agency that protected private homes and also important people like famous actors and politicians. I learned a lot about criminals. I also learned a lot about police work from my father, who was a cop for 34 years.

I had wanted to become a police officer, too. But that was impossible. I got into some trouble when I was a kid. It was a stupid high school trick, but because I was 18 years old, I was treated like an adult. I was arrested by the police, convicted, and now I have a police record. With a criminal record, I can never be a cop.

I worked for a while as a bodyguard. One of my cases was protecting a famous politician who was also a history buff. He and I became friends, he helped me go to college, and now I am a professor.

As I said, when Anne came to see me this morning, I told her I would be happy to help. We came over to the apartment building where Sarah and Bill live, and that’s when this mysterious man tried to stop us from going in.

“Let’s see if we can get into their apartment and take a look around,” I suggested.

We walked into the large white building and up to the third floor. Anne got an extra key from the apartment manager so we could get in.

“Apartment number 306, Anne?” I asked her.

“Yes. Here’s the key,” she answered.

“Let me open the door.” I took the key from her. I opened the door very slowly. One thing I learned from my work as a bodyguard: Be careful when opening a stranger’s door. You never know what’s behind it.

I opened the door slowly. I went in first, making sure everything was okay before Anne followed. The living room was large and full of expensive things: a big-screen television, a fancy stereo, a CD player, two big brown leather chairs, and a comfortable-looking sofa. The living room alone was bigger than my entire apartment.

“My God, it smells like beer and cigarettes in here! Bill and Sarah didn’t even smoke,” Anne said.

I walked to the back of the apartment and saw myself in the mirror. I am always surprised at how I look: I’m 42 years old, 5 feet 11 inches tall, balding, average weight. But when I see myself in the mirror, I look 3 inches shorter, 5 years older, and 10 pounds heavier.

I checked the windows and the closets on each side of the apartment and went into the bathroom. Then I saw something move.

I quickly turned to Anne and put my hand up in the air, meaning: “Don’t move.” I put my finger to my lips, telling her to be quiet.

Someone was in the bathroom.

### 0063 Missing Person, Part 3: “A Woman in Pain.”

I put my hand on my gun and slowly opened the door wider. I saw nothing. I carefully picked up a towel from the floor. Nothing. There must be someone in the bathroom, I thought.

In one fell swoop, I kicked the shower curtain back. “Don’t move!” I shouted.

Suddenly, a little white cat jumped out of the bathtub and scurried between my legs. A cat. I should have known.

“Oh, Jasmine! I forgot about you!” Anne said. The cat looked happy to see her. She took her into the kitchen. I poked around the rest of the bedroom and then followed Anne into the kitchen.

“Does the cat have any food left in her dish?” I asked.

“It’s almost gone. Poor Jasmine! You must be hungry.”

“Well, Bill and Sarah haven’t been gone long, we know that.” I walked over to the telephone answering machine and checked their messages. No one had called.

We continued looking through the three-bedroom apartment. There was no sign of any violence, no burglary, no break-in. I checked the master bedroom, and I saw nothing unusual – a beer bottle, photos of Bill and Sarah’s wedding, some dirty clothes, an old Time magazine.

Next to the bed, on the night table, there was a bottle of pills. “Anne, what are these pills for?”

“I think they’re for Bill’s leg. He messed up his leg playing football in college at USC,” Anne replied.

I put the bottle back on the table and sat down on the bed to think. I had no idea what happened to Anne’s sister and her brother-in-law. They seem to have just disappeared into thin air. They didn’t call anyone. There was no sign of any crime in their apartment. No one at their jobs had seen them for two days. Where could they be?

“Well, Anne, I don’t see anything here to help us. I think we should talk to the police again.”

“But I’ve tried the police, Dr. Reeves! They told me to fill out some forms and wait. They won’t do anything. That’s why I went to you for help!” She began to cry a little.

I stopped and looked at her for a second. God, I thought, this poor kid. Twenty-two and in such pain.

“Okay, well, we won’t find anything else here. Let’s go,” I said to her.

Just then I heard a telephone ringing. I turned to the phone on the table, but there was no sound. Then I saw Anne reach into her purse: it was her cellular telephone!

“That’s my cell phone, Dr. Reeves.” Anne said. “Hello?”

I watched Anne’s face as she answered the phone. First it was happy, then worried, then very sad.

“Right . . . 10 minutes . . . yes . . . see you there . . . bye!” Anne hung up and looked at me in fear.

“That was Bill. Something terrible has happened!”

### 0064 Missing Person, Part 4: “Meeting at the Café.”

“We have to go, Dr. Reeves!” Anne said excitedly. “That was Bill on the phone. He’s at a restaurant called Café Pico. Sarah’s been kidnapped!”

“Kidnapped? Are you sure?” I asked, somewhat incredulously.

“I’m sure. Someone has taken Sarah,” Anne replied. “Bill said that a man is holding her, and he will kill her if we don’t give him the ransom he’s demanding.” Anne was pulling me to the door of the apartment. “Come on! Bill said he will explain at the restaurant.”

I closed the door to the apartment and followed Anne down the stairs and to my car. The weather was typical for Los Angeles: sunny, 75 degrees, with brown smog covering the city. L.A. is a city of dreams. But for some people, it’s a city of nightmares.

Anne and I drove down Robertson Boulevard in my old red Mustang, going around cars as fast as we could without causing a pileup.

“Where is this café again?” I asked her.

“On Robertson and Pico, next to a bookstore,” Anne answered. She was justifiably nervous. You could see it in her eyes.

Arriving a few minutes later, we found a place to park in front of the bookstore and walked into the café. Bill was there waiting for us.

“Bill! Oh my God, Bill, what happened?” Anne hugged Bill, who looked tired and worried.

“Oh, this is my friend, Dr. Darren Reeves.” Anne said. “Dr. Reeves, this is Bill. Dr. Reeves is my professor at USC. But he’s also a very good detective. When I found out that you and Sarah were missing, I went to him for help.”

“It’s good to meet you, Bill,” I said.

“Um, yeah, I’m glad to meet you, too,” Bill said.

Bill, Anne, and I sat down at a table in front of the café. The waitress came to take our order. I asked for a glass of iced tea. I’m a bit of a caffeine addict, truth be told.

“Bill, tell us what happened to Sarah. Is she okay?” Anne asked impatiently.

“Sarah is fine now,” Bill said. “But for a while, I thought both of us would be killed. Two days ago, a strange man knocked on our door at the apartment. I opened the door, and before I knew what was happening, he had a gun in my face and was shouting obscenities at me.”

“What did he look like?” I asked.

“He was tall and muscular,” said Bill, “but he wore a ski mask, so I couldn’t see his face very well. He had a mustache, I think. It all happened so fast.”

“That’s okay. Go on,” I said.

“Well, the man took Sarah and me and put us in a car. He put a small towel around our eyes, tied our legs and hands together, and then drove us to another place. We were forced out of the car and into a small, dingy room.

“We were given food twice a day. I’m not sure how many kidnappers there were holding us there. I heard several voices outside the door, maybe three or four, I’m not sure. Finally this morning, about an hour ago, I was let go and given a message: If I want Sarah to be set free, I have to pay a ransom of $500,000.”

### 0065 Missing Person, Part 5: “No Police.”

“When does he want the money?” I asked.

“Tomorrow. He said he would call me this afternoon and tell me where to make the drop,” Bill said. “He also made it crystal clear that we are not to call the police. If I don’t hand over the money by the deadline, he said he’s going to kill Sarah!” Bill put his face in his hands. He turned to Anne, “Geez, Anne, I don’t know what to do!”

“We’ll get the money, Bill, don’t worry!” Anne said. “You know that my parents left Sarah and me a lot of money when they died.” Anne put her hand on Bill’s shoulder.

Anne and Sarah’s parents had owned a very large computer company in Los Angeles, Prado Computers, Incorporated. When they died a few years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Prado left their two daughters a very large pile of cash. That’s how Anne got the money to go to USC and how she could afford her cell phone, her Mercedes, and her apartment on the beach.

While Anne and Bill comforted each other, I called the young waitress over and asked for another iced tea. She wasn’t very friendly, but then most waitresses in L.A. aren’t. They all really want to be actresses.

Drinking my tea and thinking about the case, the thought occurred to me that the kidnapper must know Anne and Sarah or at least know that they had a lot of money and could get it quickly.

“I know this is a difficult time, Bill,” I interrupted, “but I need to ask you and Anne a few questions. Does your family have any enemies? Anyone who might want to hurt you?” Anne looked at Bill, and they both began to think.

The two of them spent the next 20 minutes coming up with a list of people who might want to harm them. They got the list down to two prime suspects, both of whom used to work for the Prado Computer business before they were fired. They gave me the names of the two ex-employees.

“This will be a good place for me to start,” I told them. “Now, you two need to get some rest. I’ll drive you both back to Bill’s apartment.”

“No, Dr. Reeves, I want to go with you!” Anne insisted. I found it very hard to say no, but I had to. I needed time to be alone and to get some advice from an old friend.

“I’m really sorry, Anne,” I apologized, “but you need to rest and I need time to look into these names you gave me.”

“No police!” Bill quickly added.

“Don’t worry, Bill,” I told him, “there’ll be no police involved. Not yet, anyway.”

The three of us got up and started walking toward my car. I had a funny feeling that there was more to this mystery than any of us thought.

### 0066 Missing Person, Part 6: “Kathy (Again).”

I drove Bill and Anne back to Sarah and Bill’s apartment building to drop them both off there. Anne had left her car there, so she could drive herself home. I told them to call me if anything new came up.

“Thanks for your help today, Dr. Reeves.” Anne said. “I know you’ll help us find my sister.” She gave me a big long hug.

I didn’t linger there with Anne, as much as I wanted to reassure her that things would work out. I needed to talk to an old friend, Kathy Chang, about what happened today. We were supposed to have dinner at 5:30 at her apartment, and it was already 5:20. Kathy hates it when I’m late.

I drove to Kathy’s apartment and I snagged a parking spot in front of her building. It was 5:45 and I was late. I knocked on the door and Kathy let me in.

“You’re late, Darren – as usual,” Kathy said.

I knew I was late, but Kathy and I have known each other for many years. I didn’t want to hear about all of the other times I was late, so I changed the subject. “I’m glad to see you, too, Kathy. What are we having for dinner?”

“Dinner? You come late and now you want dinner?” she replied. “How much are you willing to pay me?” She had one of her inviting smiles on her face.

“All I have is yours,” I said jokingly. I think I broke the ice with that one.

Kathy and I stopped dating over a year ago, but she still likes to pretend that we’re going out. I meet her every week for dinner, and I play along with the joke. Deep down, though, I think she’s still in love with me. I admit I have feelings for her, as well. But life keeps interfering . . .

“Okay, time for dinner. Let’s dig in.” Kathy quickly brushed her long black hair from her face, got up, and went into the kitchen.

Kathy was a reporter for Los Angeles’s biggest television station. She was both very smart and very beautiful. I met her at a conference in Hawaii about six years ago. She was now my best friend in Los Angeles. One more thing about Kathy: she is a great cook.

“Let’s eat, big guy,” she said. And so we did.

### 0067 Missing Person, Part 7: “An Accident?”

Kathy came back in the room with tonight’s dinner: Italian pasta with chicken. As we ate, I told Kathy about Anne and her missing sister.

“A strange man came to Sarah and Bill Salas’s apartment building two days ago, forced them both into a car, and took them away,” I explained. “Today, the man let Bill go and told him to get a half a million dollars or he would kill Sarah.”

“And how did you get mixed up in all this?” Kathy asked.

“Sarah’s sister Anne is my student at USC. She asked me to lend her a hand, and I said yes.”

“So, who do you think the kidnappers could be?” she asked.

“Well, Bill and Anne gave me the names of two ex-employees of Prado Computers. I’m going to see one of them tonight.”

“Where does this person work?” Kathy asked.

“He now works at a bar near the airport.”

“He’s not the person who took Sarah,” Kathy said confidently.

“Why do you say that? I haven’t even talked to him yet,” I said, surprised.

“Trust me. The man you want is smart – very smart. Smart men don’t work at bars.”

Kathy was probably right. I thanked her for the wonderful dinner and told her I would call her tomorrow if I found out anything. Even though I trust Kathy’s judgment, I decided to go visit this former employee anyway, just to be sure he wasn’t the one who took Sarah.

I drove my car down La Brea. Suddenly I heard an emergency announcement on the police scanner in my car. The radio picks up all of the police communication in the city. I had it put into my car so I could hear any important police action related to my cases. I immediately pulled over and cranked up the volume.

There was an accident on the freeway involving a black Mercedes. The woman in the car was hurt. I listened closely to the name as the radio operator gave the details: young Latina female, age 22, name – Anne Prado.

### 0068 Missing Person, Part 8: “Tracing the Plates.”

“Be careful! She might have broken bones,” the ambulance driver yelled.

I arrived at the accident scene just a few minutes after the police. Anne was already in the ambulance and ready to go to the hospital.

“Wait just one second,” I said to the police officer closing the back door of the ambulance. “I’m a friend of the victim. Can I talk to her?”

“Okay, go ahead,” she said, “but hurry up.”

“Thanks.” I turned and looked at Anne. She had hurt her arm and leg, but she was awake and able to speak. “Anne,” I said softly. “Anne, it’s me, Dr. Reeves.”

Anne opened her eyes slowly. “Dr. Reeves, wha – what are you doing here?”

“I heard about the accident on my police scanner. Anne, what happened?”

“A . . . a car . . . red car . . . going very fast . . . hit me. Hit me from behind . . . tried to kill me . . .” It was difficult for her to talk.

“A red car, Anne?” I asked, hoping to get more information. “Did you see the driver?”

“No . . . didn’t see . . . but . . . I got the license plate . . . 3XZW . . . 4 . . . 5 . . . 1,” she said, running out of breath.

“Anne, that’s wonderful! Good work!”

“Thanks, Dr. Reeves.” She smiled a little and touched my hand softly.

“Okay, buddy, you’ll have to go now,” the policewoman yelled. “She needs to get to the hospital.”

I jumped out of the ambulance and it drove away. I got back in my car and drove to the nearest pay phone. I had to find out who owned that car.

“Hello, police department? Yes, get me Officer Cho.” Cho was an old friend of mine. When I needed a favor, he was always willing to help.

“Cho? This is Darren Reeves. Yeah, look, I need some information on a car registration. License number 3XZW451 . . . right, I’ll call you back in an hour. Thanks, Cho. You’re the best.”

It was now 7:45 p.m. and I still needed to talk to one of the ex-employees of Prado Computers who worked at a bar near the airport. I drove down the freeway and arrived about 20 minutes later.

When I got to the bar, I walked inside. It smelled of old beer, old cigarettes, and old men. I sat down at the bar and ordered a drink. I was here to speak to Lenny MacKay, an ex-employee of Prado Computers.

“Excuse me, bartender,” I said to the man serving the drinks, “I’m looking for Lenny, Lenny MacKay.”

“I never heard of Lenny MacKay,” he answered very quickly. “You got the wrong place. There ain’t no Lenny MacKay working here.”

I looked into his eyes, and I knew he was lying.

I got up from the bar and walked to the back of the place. There was a door to the left. The door had a sign on it that said, “DO NOT ENTER.” I entered.

“Hey!” A man yelled at me as I went into the back room. “Who are you?”

“I’m looking for Lenny MacKay. Are you Lenny?”

“Yeah, I’m Lenny. Now who are you?” he replied.

“My name’s Reeves. Look, I’m not here to waste your time. I just want to ask you a few questions. Now, where were you two days ago at about 8:30 in the morning?”

“I was in Las Vegas with my girlfriend. Ask her. She’ll tell you that I was with her.”

I believed Lenny when he told me that he was in Vegas, but I needed to be sure. “Who’s your girlfriend? What’s her name?” I asked.

“Her name is Tanya. She’s working here tonight. You can ask her!”

I walked over to a table and found a girl sitting by herself, drinking a beer. “Are you Tanya?” I asked.

“Yeah, I’m Tanya. What do you want, bud?”

“I just have a quick question for you: Where were you two days ago?”

“Who wants to know?”

“I’m investigating a girl who’s gone missing, and I just want to clear someone of suspicion, that’s all.”

“I was in Las Vegas with my boyfriend, Lenny. Lenny MacKay.”

“That’s all I needed to know. Thanks.” I walked out of the bar and got back into my car. As usual, Kathy was right: Lenny wasn’t involved in the kidnapping.

I got back on the freeway and drove to my apartment. It was now 10:30 p.m. and I was tired. I needed to sleep before I could continue my investigation. As soon as I got into my apartment, I checked my voice mail for messages. There was only one. It was from a man with a very deep voice.

The message was short but very clear: “Darren Reeves, stop trying to find Sarah Salas! If you don’t stop looking for her now, you will die!”

### 0069 Missing Person, Part 9: “At the Beach.”

So now someone wanted to kill me. But how did anyone know I was working on this case? Was Lenny part of this kidnapping in some way? I still had more questions than I had answers about this case.

I called my friend Officer Cho back at the police station. He had the car registration information I requested earlier. The mysterious red car that hit Anne last night on the freeway belonged to John Costello, age 37, living in Santa Monica. Tomorrow I would visit Costello. Tonight, I just needed to get some sleep.

The next morning I got up early and went to visit Anne in the hospital. Luckily, she was doing just fine. I told her I would pick her up later in the afternoon and give her a ride home.

First, I went to visit June Brown, the other ex-employee of Prado Computers that Anne and Bill thought might be involved in the kidnapping. She now worked at a clothing store on the beach, Stern’s Fashions. I love going to the beach in L.A. The sun is always shining, the surfers are riding the waves, and the people all look so beautiful, just like movie stars.

I walked into the clothing store and looked around. The customers were mostly college students. “Excuse me, miss?” I said to the young sales clerk. “I’m looking for one of the employees here, a June Brown?”

“Who’s looking for her?” she asked, a little suspicious.

“My name is Darren Reeves. I just wanted to ask her a few questions.”

“What kind of questions do you want to ask her?” she replied.

“Just some questions. Look, is June Brown here today or not?” I was getting impatient with this girl.

“I’m June Brown, and I don’t know if I want to answer your questions, mister.” She crossed her arms and looked at me with a very unfriendly face. “Who do you work for? The police?”

“No, I don’t work for the police. I’m a, eh . . . private detective,” I answered. “I just want to know where you were three days ago, in the morning. Can you just tell me that?”

“I don’t remember. I think I was with my boyfriend,” she said with a smile. “Yeah, that’s right, I was with my boyfriend.”

“Can I talk to your boyfriend?”

“No, you can’t,” she said, suddenly getting very angry.

“Why not?” I asked.

“Because he doesn’t want to talk to you!” June said. “Look, buddy, I don’t have to answer your questions. Now why don’t you just get out of my store?” She turned around and walked away.

I couldn’t force her to talk to me, so I didn’t try. I left the store and got back in my car. Maybe this girl was involved in the kidnapping. Maybe she and her boyfriend were trying to get even with Prado Computers. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

### 0070 Missing Person, Part 10: “The Bartender Shows Up.”

It was time to try a different approach. I decided to find John Costello first and talk to him. I wanted to find out why his car hit Anne’s and almost killed her. I knew Costello lived in Santa Monica, so I drove up the freeway and got off near Main Street. I went to the address Officer Cho gave me and knocked on the door. No one answered. I knocked on the apartment manager’s door. An old woman answered. “Excuse me, I’m trying to find John Costello. He lives in number 503.”

“Mr. Costello lived – past tense – in 503. He moved out two months ago,” she said.

“Do you know where he lives now or where he works?” I asked.

“I don’t know where he moved to, but I think he still works at the bar on 4th Street.”

“Thanks for your help.” I got back in my car and drove down to the bar. It was only 10:00 a.m., and already there were cars parked outside the place. Some people like to start drinking really early.

As I walked down the street toward the bar, I heard two gunshots. I immediately reached for my gun, which I keep on my belt. The gun is registered, of course, but I only carry it with me when I think there might be trouble. I ran toward the bar and I heard another sound, like the wheels of a car turning very fast. I slowly opened the front door of the bar and looked around. There was a man standing over a dead body. The floor was covered with blood.

“Don’t shoot!” the man yelled at me.

“It’s okay, I’m a private detective. What happened here?” I asked.

“Someone just ran in here and shot John! I think he’s dead,” the man answered.

“John? The dead man’s name is John?” I asked.

“Yeah, he is – was – the bartender. His name’s John Costello.”

“Someone call the police,” I said. “Did anyone recognize the man who shot Costello? Did anyone see what he looked like?” There were four men at the bar. Each man looked at the others. Everyone just shook their heads.

“Uh, I really didn’t see him very well,” said one man.

“Yeah, it’s dark in here. I didn’t see his face,” said another.

I decided not to stay at the bar. I didn’t want the police to find out about Sarah’s kidnapping and how Costello may have been connected. I drove back toward downtown.

I stopped to have lunch at my favorite sushi bar and thought about the case. I was now more confused than ever. This morning I guessed that John Costello might be the kidnapper. Now Costello was dead. The girl at the beach store might be involved, but I had no evidence of that. I was stuck. At around 2:00 p.m. I went to the hospital and picked up Anne. She was feeling much better and was happy to see me.

“Have you heard anything from Bill about giving the money to the kidnappers?” I asked her.

“No, Bill hasn’t called.”

“Well, let’s get over there and see what happened.” We drove over to Bill and Sarah’s apartment, and we were surprised to see two police cars outside the building. Bill was sitting on the steps of the building, crying.

“What happened?!” Anne said to me as we parked the car. “Why are the police here?”

“I don’t know, Anne,” I said. “Let’s just try to stay calm and find out what is going on.” As we walked toward the apartment building, I had a feeling in my stomach that something was wrong – very wrong.

“Oh, Anne, she’s dead! She’s dead!” Bill cried. He jumped up to hug Anne. “Sarah’s dead!”

“Bill, what happened?” I asked. “Did the kidnappers call?” I saw that Anne was in shock. She couldn’t believe what Bill was telling her.

“No, I made a terrible mistake,” Bill said. “I got scared, so I called the police this morning. I told them everything. I told them that Sarah had been kidnapped. Then two hours later . . . she was dead! I found Sarah’s body in the street in front of the apartment building!”

Bill began to cry again, and Anne looked like she was going to fall down. I grabbed her arm and helped her sit down on the steps. I turned to the police officer standing next to us. “Where was the body found?” I asked.

“In the street, like Mr. Salas said,” he answered. “We got here about 30 minutes ago. She was already dead. She had been cut in the throat by some type of knife or piece of glass.”

It was over. I had tried my best, but Sarah was now dead. I thought about all the things that had happened. I even blamed myself. Maybe I should have . . . But you can’t blame yourself. Sometimes, you just have bad luck. There was nothing more I could do. I shook hands with Bill and gave Anne one last hug. I decided I would call my friend Officer Cho and tell him what I knew. Maybe they could find the person who killed Sarah.

As I was about to leave, I noticed a list of names on the mailboxes of Bill and Sarah’s apartment building. I don’t know why I decided to look at the list. Sometimes you just do the right thing at the right time and get lucky. This was one of those times. I recognized one of the names on the list. I couldn’t believe my eyes, so I looked more closely a second time. Yes, I was right. The name on the list read “Costello, John – Apt. 1A.” John Costello lived in the same building as Bill and Sarah Salas.

### 0071 Missing Person, Part 11: “Right on Schedule.”

Things were starting to make sense to me now. I was beginning to see what had really happened to Sarah Salas and why she was killed. But I had no proof to show that I was right. I needed to get some real evidence.

I went home and rang up Kathy Chang. I asked her to do me a big favor that night. Fortunately, she said yes. Now I was ready. I turned on the television and watched the baseball game; I had some time to kill until it was dark outside. When it was nighttime, I got in my car and started driving.

When I got near Bill and Sarah’s apartment building, I turned off the lights of my car and parked about a block away. I didn’t want anyone to know I was here. It was now 7:30 p.m. I was right on schedule.

Very quietly, I walked up the sidewalk in front of the apartment building. I needed to break into Costello’s apartment, which was on the first floor. I looked into the apartment through the window. There was a light on. I took out my gun and made sure I had bullets in it. I slowly began to open the front window, which was already cracked open. After about a minute, I got the window open and stepped inside the living room of the apartment.

I saw a light on in the kitchen. There was someone in there, and this time it was no cat. I walked to the kitchen door; I needed to surprise the person if I was going to catch him. As I opened the door, I yelled as loud as I could, “Don’t move!” The man turned around suddenly. I had guessed right: it was Bill.

“What?! What are you . . .” Before he finished his sentence, Bill took the frying pan he was holding and hurled it toward my face. I ducked down and the pan flew over my head.

Bill came at me. He pushed me to the ground and hit me in the stomach. I hit him back in the face. We hit each other several times, until I noticed that my gun was now on the floor next to us. I stopped hitting Bill and reached for the gun. But Bill saw what I was doing and jumped up. He grabbed the gun before I could get it in my hands and pointed it at me.

“Don’t move, Reeves.” Bill had a big smile on his face. I was not smiling.

“So you figured out the truth, eh?” Bill said. “You think you’re so smart, don’t you, Reeves? Well, you were right. I did kill Sarah, and now I will get all of her money. But you will just get a bullet in your head. That’s your reward for being so smart.”

Bill looked at me with real hatred. I have seen men kill before. I know the look in their eyes before they kill. I knew that I didn’t have much time to think of something. Bill stood in front of me with the gun pointed at my face. Suddenly I remembered the pills I had found in Bill and Sarah’s bedroom for Bill’s bad leg.

Now I knew what to do.

### 0072 Missing Person, Part 12: “Kathy to the Rescue.”

Without thinking for another second, I kicked Bill in his right knee. He screamed in pain and fell backward onto his back. The gun fell to the ground. I picked it up and pointed it at Bill.

“The game is over, Bill,” I said, moving the gun closer to his face. “I know that you killed John Costello, too. Was he your partner in kidnapping Sarah?”

“Costello was an idiot. He was supposed to kill Anne and then keep quiet. But he told me he wanted more money or he would tell the police everything he knew. So I had to kill him so he wouldn’t blab to the cops.”

“And you came to Costello’s apartment tonight to get rid of any evidence that connected you to him?” I asked.

“Costello had my name written down on a sheet of paper I gave him. I had to find the paper and get rid of it.” Just then I heard a knock on the door, and someone came in. It was Kathy Chang.

“Kathy! Right on time!” I said. “Did you call the police?”

“Yes, they’re on their way here right now. I have a cameraperson from the television station outside. We’re ready to report the story.”

The police arrived a few minutes later and arrested Bill Salas for the murder of his wife and John Costello. Anne would be devastated, of course, but at least now she would know the truth. Now it was really over, and the murderer had been found.

A week later, I met Kathy at her apartment for our usual dinner. Of course, she wanted to know all about the case of Sarah Salas’s kidnapping. We talked over a wonderful meal of baked chicken.

“I understand that Bill killed his wife, Sarah, for her money,” Kathy said, “but how much money was he going to get?”

“Bill had a two-million-dollar life insurance policy on Sarah,” I responded. “Bill would get two million plus half of the money from Prado Computers.”

“And how was John Costello involved in this whole thing?”

“John Costello lived in the same apartment building as Bill and Sarah,” I said. “He moved in a few months ago and became friends with Bill. But John liked to go to Las Vegas and gamble. He also liked to smoke and drink. So, he needed money – lots of money.”

“And Bill gave him a chance to make a lot of money by helping him kidnap Sarah,” Kathy said.

“Exactly. Bill told John he would give him $500,000 if he helped him kidnap Sarah.”

“But how did they take Sarah? Where did they keep her?”

“Bill had planned everything out very carefully,” I explained. “He told John Costello to call Sarah on the phone to ask her for some help with his computer. When she got there, John tied her up and kept her in his room. Bill left Los Angeles for two days in a rented car so people would think that both he and Sarah had disappeared. And it worked: Anne called me because she thought that Bill and Sarah were in trouble.”

“What went wrong with Bill’s perfect plan, then?”

“The problem was that John Costello wasn’t a very good helper,” I said. “He was supposed to kill Anne on the freeway, but he didn’t. Then he told Bill that if Bill didn’t give him more money, he would tell the police about the kidnapping.”

“That’s when Bill decided to kill Costello, to make sure Costello didn’t tell the police?”

“Exactly. He went to the bar where Costello worked and killed him,” I said. “Then he went back to Costello’s apartment to kill his wife. He cut her throat and put her body in the street. But when I discovered that John Costello lived in the same apartment building, I knew it was no coincidence, and that’s how I figured it out.”

I took a drink of wine and looked at Kathy. She really was a very beautiful woman.

“Well, let’s not think about Anne or Bill or John Costello,” Kathy said. She smiled and raised her glass of wine. Perhaps I’ve been working too hard on this case. I’ve forgotten the simple pleasures of life. It was time to spend some more time on the good things in life, like a good glass of wine, a good meal, and Kathy’s wonderful smile.

### 0073 Halloween

As a kid, I always loved Halloween. I liked dressing up in a costume that I had picked out at the store or, more often, that I had made out of odds and ends at home. The best part was going trick-or-treating. Some years, I went with my brothers and sisters. When I got a little older, I went with my friends.

We would go to all the houses in our neighborhood and knock on the door or ring the doorbell. When the door opened, we would yell, "Trick or treat!" We never played tricks and always got treats. The neighbors would put some candy in our bags, and we would go home at the end of the night and eat to our hearts' content.

To get ready for Halloween, my parents would buy pumpkins from the market or from the makeshift pumpkin patches on the side of the road so we could make jack-o’-lanterns. We’d take a pumpkin, cut off the top, scoop out the seeds from the inside, and carve a face on the front. Sometimes we carved a scary face and sometimes we carved funny ones. At night, we would put candles inside the jack-o’-lanterns and put them on our doorstep.

One year we had a Halloween party. Our friends came over dressed up as witches, ghosts, superheroes, cartoon characters, and anything else you can think of. We played party games like Bobbing for Apples, and we even created a haunted house in our backyard. It was a blast! Halloween is truly a holiday for kids.

### 0074 Reserving a Rental Car

I will be in Chicago next week and need a rental car. I called up Bargain Rental Car and made a reservation. After I got through the phone tree, I spoke with a reservation agent.

Agent: Welcome to Bargain Rental Car.

Jeff: I'd like to reserve a rental car.

Agent: What city will you be picking up from?

Jeff: Chicago.

Agent: Which airport location? O’Hare or Midway?

Jeff: Hmm. I'm not sure. Is there a downtown location?

Agent: Sure. We have an office at 401 State Street.

Jeff: Is that near Prairie State College?

Agent: I really don't know.

Jeff: That's okay. I'll go ahead and make a reservation for that location.

Agent: For what date and time?

Jeff: For November 11th, around 7 p.m.

Agent: Returning to the same location?

Jeff: No. I’d like to drop it off at the Chicago O’Hare airport.

Agent: Okay. On what date and time?

Jeff: It'll be that Sunday, November 13th, around the same time.

Agent: What size car would you like? A compact, mid-size, or full-size?

Jeff: I’d like the most economical.

Agent: That would be the compact. The rental fee would be $32.25 a day, giving you a grand total of $62.50 for the two days.

Jeff: Does that include taxes and fees?

Agent: No. With all applicable taxes and fees, you grand total comes to $77.40.

Jeff: Okay, that's fine.

Agent: Your last name?

Jeff: McQuillan. M-C-Q-U-I-L-L-A-N.

Agent: What credit card will you be using?

Jeff: I'll be using a MasterCard.

Agent: Okay, I have a compact reserved for pickup at our downtown location on November 11th at 7 p.m., returning November 13th at 7 p.m. at Chicago O’Hare. Is there another reservation I can help you with?

Jeff: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: It's my pleasure. Have a good afternoon and thank you for calling Bargain Rental Car.

### 0075 Getting Childcare

My friend Susan is an engineer, and she's also a single mom. She has been working some odd hours lately and was having a tough time finding childcare for her four-year-old daughter and her eight-year-old son.

Her daughter, Kimberly, is enrolled in a preschool, and Susan is able to drop her off on her way to work. But the preschool closes at 6:00 p.m., and sometimes Susan can't get there in time to pick her up.

Her son, Paul, is in the second grade and goes to a public school near their house. Paul gets out of school at 3:00 p.m., but Susan never gets off work before 6:00 p.m., and sometimes later.

So, what can she do with the kids after school? I went with Susan to check out a latchkey program at the local community center. It seemed like a good idea. Paul would be picked up from his school, and he could stay at the center to do his homework and to play in the center until as late as 7:00 p.m. The tuition was fairly low and there was rolling admission. The trouble was, there was very little supervision of the kids, and the staff seemed inexperienced.

Now, Susan is considering hiring a nanny. The nanny would pick both kids up from their schools and bring them home. The nanny could make dinner for them and stay with them until she got home. This would be ideal, but a good nanny is hard to come by and is very expensive to hire, even the ones who don't live in.

I don't envy Susan. Single moms – and dads – have it tough.

### 0076 Asking for and Giving Instructions

My supervisor at work asked me the other day to help out one of the new employees. She needs some basic orientation on how to log in to our network. So I made an appointment with her to come to my cubicle for a little training session.

Jeff: Hi, Lucy. How are you settling in?

Lucy: Just fine, thanks. I appreciate you taking the time to help me out with this software. May I ask you what we will be covering today?

Jeff: Sure. Before I do that, could you tell me if you've worked with this program before? That will help me figure out how to proceed.

Lucy: I've done a little work with it, but not much.

Jeff: Well, it's a good idea to have the manual ready, since it can get a bit hairy. You should start by logging in with your username and password.

Lucy: How do I do that?

Jeff: You can just click on the button in the corner. Be sure to enter the password you created. You can write it down until you memorize it, but you might want to keep it in a safe place.

Lucy: Okay. Then what?

Jeff: Well, then just select the network you want to work with, and you're all set.

Lucy: Great, thanks for your help, Jeff. May I trouble you to show me how to print reports out from the program?

Jeff: Sure. I'll do what I can to help.

### 0077 Shopping at the Mall

I needed a new pair of pants for a wedding I was attending next week, so I went to the mall during my lunch hour. The mall had a big variety of stores, including two department stores, so I was sure to find something that was just right. I found a space in the parking structure and entered the mall through the main entrance. This was right next to the food court.

Okay, where to start?

I headed to one of the two department stores. On the way there, though, I saw a nice pair of pants in a window display of a men’s clothing store. I decided to go in. As I walked in, I saw a sales clerk hanging some shirts on a rack.

She said, “Hi, can I help you find something?”

“Oh, I’m just browsing,” I said.

“Okay. Let me know if you need any help.” I told her thanks, and started looking around the store. There were some nice sweaters folded on the shelves and some dress pants on the racks. I made my way toward the back of the store and found the same pair of pants I saw in the window display. And, they were on sale! They were 50 percent off. I started looking for my size. There were plenty of smalls and larges, but no mediums.

The sales clerk was walking by just then so I asked her, “Do you have any other sizes in the back?” But, I was out of luck. This was all they had. “But,” she said, “I have another pair of pants in a medium and they’ve been marked down, too. Would you like to try them on?”

I said I did and followed her to the dressing room. She said, “My name is Cheryl. Let me know if you need anything else.” I tried the pants on and they fit perfectly. I liked the color, too.

I took the pair of pants to the register. The sales clerk asked, “Are you ready?” I told her I was and she started ringing me up. The clerk told me the total and asked me, “How would you like to pay for this?”

“With my MasterCard,” I said and handed her my credit card.

She processed the card and asked me sign the credit card receipt. She handed me a copy and a bag with my new pair of pants in it. She said, “There you go. I hope you like the pair of pants. Thanks for coming in.”

I thanked her and left. I couldn’t believe I got my shopping done so quickly. There’s a first time for everything.

### 0078 Seeing a Play

I ran into my neighbor Dennis yesterday afternoon. He asked if I wanted two tickets to the theater. He had season tickets but couldn't go to this performance. It was opening night of Shakespeare's The Tempest. I jumped at his offer and invited Lucy to come along.

We arrived at the theater half an hour before opening curtain. We had the tickets in hand and didn't need to pick them up at the will call window. The doors to the theater were open and we handed our tickets to the ticket takers standing in the doorway.

We looked for our seats and were pleasantly surprised to find that we had some of the best seats in the house! I thought we would be sitting in the balcony, but we were in the orchestra section in the center. This was great! The lights dimmed and the curtain went up.

At the end of the second act, there was an intermission. Lucy and I went into the lobby and bought drinks from the bar. After about 15 minutes, the lights flickered and we went back to our seats.

After the last act, the audience gave the actors a standing ovation. This was the best play I had seen in ages. The acting was superb, and the staging and direction were fresh. I couldn't have asked for a better theater experience. I owed Dennis big time for giving me his tickets.

### 0079 Disagreeing Politely in a Business Setting

Lucy: I don't think this is going to work. This plan calls for the new office to open by July and I think that's too ambitious. I don't see how the groundwork can be done any earlier than September.

Jeff: I understand your concern. I don't want to rush the opening of the new office either. But, as I see it, a lot of the preparations were made last year when we considered opening an office in Miami. Even though the site is different, a lot of the cost projections are the same.

Lucy: That may be, but remember that one of the reasons we scrapped the Miami plan was because the budget was too big.

Jeff: That's not how I saw it. I think the major reason we didn't go ahead with the Miami plan was a problem with timing but I know that the budget was a concern, too. As you can see, though, this plan has a lower budget than the Miami plan.

Lucy: I don't agree. If you add in all of the extras, the budget is the same, if not higher. I think we need to go back to the drawing board on this.

Jeff: I have to disagree. This plan is the best we've come up with and is workable.

Lucy: I'm afraid we just don't see eye to eye on this. Let's call a meeting with the rest of the team and see what they think.

Jeff: Okay, let's do that.

### 0080 Asking for Directions

I went to Vancouver for a meeting this week. I have always liked Vancouver, and on top of that, my cousin Dominick just moved there. I got in touch with him and he invited me over to see his new place.

On the way over, though, I got a little lost. I knew I was in the right area, but I was turned around. He lived in an apartment over an old bakery and I couldn't find it.

I stopped a man who was walking by to ask for directions.

Lucy: Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building?

Man: The Cross Bakery building? Oh sure. You're actually walking in the opposite direction.

Lucy: Oh, you're kidding! I thought I was heading east.

Man: No, east is the other direction. To get to the Bakery, you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway. When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm, you hang a left. Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left.

Lucy: Okay, let me see if I've got that. I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway, then I make a left and the building is on my left- hand side. Is that right?

Man: Yeah, you've got it. Do you want me to show you the way?

Lucy: Thanks for the offer, but I think I've got it. Hopefully, I won't get lost again on my way there!

### 0081 Airplane Announcements

I had to fly from Minneapolis to Los Angeles recently and, like most travelers, I've almost memorized the standard safety announcement made by the flight attendants. It goes something like this:

Good afternoon and welcome to Flight 345, service to Los Angeles International Airport. We appreciate your full attention to this important safety announcement.

### 0082 In a Rut

Woman: What do you want to do tonight?

Man: I don't know. What do you want to do?

W: I have no idea. Do you think we're in a rut?

M: What do you mean?

W: Well, we do the same things every weekend. We go to the same restaurants. We see the same friends. You know what I mean?

M: Yeah, I guess you're right. It's easy to get bogged down in the day-to-day and forget to change things up once in a while. Let's break out and do something completely different tonight.

W: Okay, I'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight. Hmm, we could go to a concert. There is a good one tonight. I bet it's not sold out but we'll have to drive an hour to the venue.

M: An hour? That's a bit of a bummer. Let me take a peek and see what else there is. How about going dancing? We haven't done that in a while. There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights. Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor, and the cover charge isn't bad.

W: I'm not really in the mood for dancing, actually. You know what? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging, after all. How about you?

M: Yeah, I was hoping you’d say that. It's nice to have the option to go out but I’d rather stay in. Maybe we can go out tomorrow night.

W: Yeah, definitely tomorrow night.

### 0083 Planning a Business Luncheon

One of my co-workers, Betty, was retiring this month after working for the company 23 years. I was put in charge of planning a retirement lunch in her honor at a restaurant nearby. The company was picking up the tab and it was up to me to set a day and time. After asking the people in the department and finding out their availability, I called the restaurant to make a reservation.

Manager: Bruno's.

Jeff: Hi, I'm calling from Nika Corporation. We would like to hold a business lunch at the restaurant.

Manager: Oh, certainly. I'm Linda, the manager. I can help you with that. How many will there be in your party?

Jeff: There will be about 18 people.

Manager: Okay. For a party that size, we have a separate banquet room in the back.

Jeff: Is there an extra charge to reserve the room?

Manager: No, as long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests, there is no extra charge.

Jeff: That's great. I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room, then, for Friday, December 2, at around noon. This is a retirement party and we’d like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne. Will that be acceptable?

Manager: The cake is no problem at all, but we do charge a corkage fee of $15 a bottle for any alcohol not purchased from the restaurant.

Jeff: Oh, that's fine.

Manager: Great. I have the banquet room reserved for a luncheon for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December. May I have your name and contact information?

Jeff: Sure. I'm Jeff McQuillan and my number is 323-555-6840, extension 42.

Manager: Thanks, Mr. McQuillan. I'll give you a call a week in advance to confirm the arrangements.

Jeff: Sounds good. Thanks for your help.

Manager: Thank you for choosing Bruno's. We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd.

### 0084 Bargaining with a Seller

It was Saturday afternoon and I was shopping in the garment district in downtown L.A. If you want to find good deals on clothes, shoes, and accessories, this is the place to come. To get the best deal, though, you have to be ready to bargain.

I walked by a stall and saw a purse I liked. The owner had just finished making a sale.

Lucy: Does this come in any other colors?

Man: Yeah, we have this one in white and blue. I also have this other style in green.

Lucy: How much is the blue one?

Man: It's $32.

Lucy: $32? What about the green one?

Man: That's $30.

Lucy: That seems a little high. Can you do better on the price?

Man: This is a designer bag and it's good quality. It's a bargain at that price.

Lucy: Is that your best offer?

Man: That's the best I can do.

Lucy: Well, I don't know. I think I'll shop around.

Man: Okay, how about $28.

Lucy: That's still more than I wanted to spend. What if I take the blue one and the green one?

Man: I'll give you both of them for $55.

Lucy: That's not much of a break on the price. How about $50 for both?

Man: You drive a hard bargain. The best I can do is $54. You won't find it cheaper anywhere else.

Lucy: Why don't we split the difference and make it $52?

Man: Okay, okay. You've got a deal.

### 0085 The Blind Date

I broke up with my boyfriend last month. We had gone out for a year and I was ready to settle down but I could tell that he still wanted to play the field before getting married. I don't think Don ever cheated on me, but I finally realized that he wasn't the marrying type.

My friend Sheila was thrilled to hear that we had split up. She never liked Don and she was anxious to set me up with some of her single friends. I told her that I didn't want to go on any blind dates but she kept telling me about this guy, Alan. She thought he was my soul mate and she was sure that he would be my Mr. Right. According to Sheila, he was good-looking, he had a good sense of humor, he was bright and witty, and was kind and considerate. In the end, I told Sheila to give him my number. He called and we agreed to meet for coffee.

I walked into the café and looked around. I saw a nice-looking guy sitting by himself near the window.

Lucy: Hi. Are you Alan?

Alan: Yeah. You must be Lucy.

Lucy: Did you have trouble finding the café?

Alan: No, I've actually been here before. I'm really glad you could make it. Sheila has been telling me all about you.

Lucy: Well, Sheila likes to play matchmaker. But it's nice to meet you, too.

Alan: To tell the truth, I'm not big on blind dates.

Lucy: Yeah, me neither but I'm glad I came.

Alan: Yes, so am I.

### 0086 Asking About Jobs

I was at the store the other day. I saw a former co-worker, Michael, across the room. He used to work at my company until he quit a few months ago to start a new job as a public relations officer at Missouri University. It's a job he's been working toward for years. He wasn't happy working for a corporation and wanted to get into either a non- profit organization or a university. I wanted to see how he was doing. The truth was, I was thinking of making a move myself.

Becky: Hey, Michael. Remember me? I'm Becky. We used to work at Lekmans together.

Michael: Oh, sure. How are you? Long time, no see. How are things at Lekmans?

Becky: It's about the same. I've been thinking of making a change myself. Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university?

Michael: No, not at all. Go ahead.

Becky: Well, I was wondering what the salaries are like. I mean, are they much lower than the corporate world?

Michael: Well, I can't speak for all universities, but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lekmans. I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation.

Becky: Yeah, that's what I thought, but I've heard that the perks are better. I was wondering if that was really true.

Michael: I'd have to say yes and no on that. I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lekmans but I get to take classes for free if I want to. I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that.

Becky: Oh, that's great. It sounds like you're really happy with your move.

Michael: Yeah, I guess I am. Working at a university really suits me.

### 0087 Hotel Housekeeping

I’m so glad that the hotel I booked didn’t turn out to be a dump. The last time I went on vacation, I booked it online sight unseen, and it turned out to be a run down motel. This hotel was completely different. The décor was tasteful and updated, the staff was friendly, and the rooms were well-maintained.

Well, that is, until my second day there. When I left my room in the morning, I had removed the “Do Not Disturb” sign from my door so that housekeeping would know I needed my room made up. When I got back in the afternoon, though, it hadn’t been done properly. The maid had made the bed, cleaned the bathroom, and re-stocked the mini-bar, but she hadn’t vacuumed the carpet and didn’t leave any soap or clean towels. I called down to the front desk to make a complaint.

“Front desk. How may I help you?”

“Hello. I’m in room 1201 and housekeeping didn’t leave any soap or clean towels. And, the floor still needs to be vacuumed.”

“Oh, I’m so sorry. Let me connect you with housekeeping.” I waited on hold.

“Housekeeping.”

“Yes, this is room 1201. The maid who cleaned my room didn’t leave any soap or clean towels, and the floor needs vacuuming.”

“Okay. I’ll get someone up there right away to take care of that.”

About 10 minutes later, the maid knocked on the door. I stepped out of the room and she left the toiletries in the bathroom and vacuumed. That was pretty quick service. I’m glad I didn’t get the run-around.

### 0088 Socializing at a Reception

Man: Hi. It's a bit crowded in here.

Woman: Yes, it's always like this on the first night of the conference. Is this your first time attending?

Man: Yes, it is. By the way, I'm Dan Morimoto.

Woman: I'm Gwen Renault. Were you here this morning for the opening keynote? I thought the speaker was excellent.

Man: No, unfortunately, I didn't arrive to the venue until late morning. Luckily, I pre- registered and just had to pick up my registration packet, so I was able to catch the luncheon speaker and she was very good.

Woman: You know, I attended a really interesting session this afternoon on ethics in the profession. It was a panel discussion and there was some lively debate. The luncheon speaker, Stephanie Morse, presented some of her findings from her new ground- breaking study.

Man: I'm sorry I missed it. It sounds interesting. Do you plan on staying for the duration of the conference?

Woman: No, I'm afraid I have to leave early tomorrow. Will you excuse me? I see a colleague of mine over there and I'd like to say hello.

Man: Oh, sure. It was nice meeting you.

Woman: Yes, you, too.

### 0089 A Good Listener

Woman: Hi. Long time no see. How have you been?

Man: Oh, I've been fine, but I'm having some trouble with my son.

Woman: Tell me all about it.

Man: Oh, he's 14 and in the past few months, he's become quieter and a bit secretive. He locks himself in his room and I think he’s running around with the wrong crowd.

Woman: Oh, I see. What makes you think that?

Man: Well, he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band and one night last weekend, he came home really late, way past his curfew.

Woman: Really? What happened?

Man: He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home.

Woman: I see what you mean. I understand why you're concerned. Have you tried talking to your son about it?

Man: I haven't yet. I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through.

Woman: You may be right, but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life.

Man: You're right. I should talk to him. Sometimes, it's not easy being a parent. Thanks. It helps to get it off my chest. You're always so easy to talk to.

Woman: I don't know about that, but my door is always open. Stop by anytime.

### 0090 Room Service

I was staying at a nice resort hotel in Arizona on a short vacation. I had been out on the golf course playing a round of golf. When I got back into the room, I was feeling pretty hungry. I was meeting some friends for a late dinner around 8:30. I wanted a snack. I took a look at the room service menu and called their number.

Woman: Room service. What would you like to order?

Jeff: Hi, I'm in room 1201 and I'd like an order of the calamari and a slice of cheesecake.

Woman: Do you want the calamari appetizer or the entrée?

Jeff: I'd like the appetizer.

Woman: Anything to drink?

Jeff: A diet Coke. About how long will that take?

Woman: It'll be about 30 minutes.

Jeff: Okay. Thanks.

There was a knock on my door about a half hour later.

Jeff: Who is it?

Woman: Room service...Hi. Where would you like me to put the tray?

Jeff: On the desk would be fine.

Woman: The total is $16.75.

Jeff: Oh, that's higher than I'd expected.

Woman: There's a 12% service charge for room service and there's also the usual food tax.

Jeff: Oh, I see. Can I charge it to the room?

Woman: Sure. Just fill in the total here, write in your room number, and sign at the bottom.

Jeff: Okay, there you go. Thanks.

Woman: Thank you and have a nice day.

The calamari and the cheesecake really hit the spot.

### 0091 Thanksgiving

Thanksgiving reminds us to be grateful, but for a lot of people, the holiday also means a weekend of eating a lot and watching football, and my family is no exception.

My family likes to have a traditional Thanksgiving dinner each year. We invite people from our extended family. We also invite close friends, especially those who don't have family in town. When it comes to Thanksgiving dinner, our motto is “The more the merrier.”

Our dinner, of course, starts with a big turkey, baked in the oven. I always carve it before it's served. Then we have the fixings. We always have mashed potatoes, stuffing, yams, cranberries, and corn on the cob. Some years, we go wild and have other vegetables and sides. And for dessert, we have pumpkin pie. My wife is not a big fan of pumpkin pie so for her, we also have ice cream.

After we have a really big meal, we usually watch football on TV. Things usually get pretty rowdy since there are always fans on both sides rooting for their own team to win. Last year, my uncle almost got into a fistfight with my nephew. Luckily, no one‚ and no furniture, was harmed. That was a relief!

### 0092 Types of Work

I got a call yesterday from Amy, a co-worker from the office. She and I work in the same department. We've had lunch at work a few times, but I really didn't know her that well. I was really glad she called.

Kevin: Hello.

Amy: Hi. Could I speak to Kevin?

Kevin: This is Kevin.

Amy: Oh, hi. It's Amy, from work.

Kevin: Oh, hey, how's it going? I didn't recognize your voice.

Amy: Not bad. Listen, the reason I'm calling is that I'm having a dinner party a week from Saturday at my place around seven thirty. I wanted to see if you could make it.

Kevin: So, it's not this Saturday but the Saturday after that. That would be the 17th.

Amy: Yeah, that's right, the following Saturday – the 17th.

Kevin: Let me just check my calendar. Yeah, I think I can make it. Are you inviting anyone else from work?

Amy: Yeah, I am. Jennifer from marketing already RSVP’d, so she'll be there for sure, and I'm waiting to hear back from James in accounting. I've also invited a few other friends.

Kevin: Just out of curiosity, are they in finance, too?

Amy: No. My friend Janis is in the medical field. She's an orthopedic surgeon. She's bringing her boyfriend, Tim, and I think he's an engineer in the automobile industry. Then there's Megan. She works part-time in retail and moonlights as a tour guide on the weekends. She's been wanting to get into the hospitality industry for a long time.

Kevin: Wow, that sounds like a great group of people. I'm looking forward to it. Can I bring anything?

Amy: No, that's okay. Just come and bring your appetite.

Kevin: Sounds great. Thanks for the invitation.

Amy: No problem. I'm glad you can make it. See you in the office tomorrow.

Kevin: See you then. Bye.

### 0093 Diversity at Work

Jeff: What were you and Richard talking about earlier? It looked intense.

Lucy: Yeah, Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate.

Jeff: Oh, no. I know how insensitive he can be. What has he done now?

Lucy: He asked me how long it took me to learn English.

Jeff: But you were born and raised in California!

Lucy: Yeah, but I get that sometimes. It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U.S., we'll always be foreigners in their eyes.

Jeff: What a racist! How can you stand working with the guy?

Lucy: You know, Richard isn't such a bad guy. He made the comment out of ignorance, not malice.

Jeff: So, what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English?

Lucy: I told him 28 years, and he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week. He was puzzled for a minute and then he got it.

Jeff: Are you sure he really got the message?

Lucy: Yeah, I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English.

Jeff: That's hilarious! What did he say?

Lucy: He said, "36 years," and we both laughed about it. He apologized and now it's all good.

Jeff: I'm glad. I bet he won't make that mistake again.

### 0094 Nervous at an Interview I

I was on my way to an interview and there was a lot of traffic on the road. I got to the office in the nick of time for my appointment. I walked into the lobby of the building and looked at the directory. I saw that Casey Enterprises was on the penthouse floor and headed to the elevator. The door was just closing.

David: Could you hold the elevator, please? Thanks a lot.

Woman: No problem. What floor?

David: I'm headed to the 18th floor, the top floor.

Woman: Oh, so am I.

David: Do you work there? I have an interview today with Dale Mendoza. Do you know her?

Woman: Yeah, I know her pretty well.

David: To tell you the truth, I'm really nervous. I had a dream last night that I was being interviewed by a three-headed monster that kept trying to bite my head off. Oh, wow, my palms are sweaty just thinking about it. I just hope Ms. Mendoza won't be able to hear my teeth chattering. I just hope I get though this in one piece.

The elevator doors opened just then and we both walked out. I don't know why I poured my heart out to a perfect stranger, but it actually seemed to help me chill out a bit. I didn't feel quite as nervous.

We were in the reception area and I headed to the reception desk. The woman started walking in the other direction. She turned and called back, "Good luck," with a smile.

### 0095 Nervous at an Interview II

I was just in time for my interview and I was very nervous. I walked up to the receptionist. She was talking into a headset and typing on her keyboard.

David: Good morning. I'm David Laso. I have an appointment with Dale Mendoza at 10 o'clock. Could you please let her know that I'm here?

Receptionist: Please have a seat and I'll tell her.

About three minutes later, a man came out of the office and approached me. He introduced himself as Ben, Ms. Mendoza’s administrative assistant. He told me he would show me to her office.

I followed him and we stopped in front of an office door with a placard on the door with the name "Dale Mendoza" and her title "Vice President" written on it. Ben knocked on the door and opened it. By this time, I was feeling more confident and was actually looking forward to the interview.

Then I saw Dale Mendoza. She was the same woman who was in the elevator on my way up. I had been so nervous that I just couldn't stop talking. I had told her how nervous I was about this interview. I had even told her about my nightmare with a three-headed monster interviewing me for a job. And now, here she was, my potential new boss.

Dale: Hello, you must be David. It's nice to meet you.

There was a frog in my throat. My heart was beating a mile a minute.

David: It's nice to meet you, too.

Dale: Have a seat and make yourself comfortable. You see? I only have one head and I don't even bite.

Needless to say, that was not my best interview. But, you live and learn. I'll know next time to keep my mouth shut!

### 0096 High School Reunion

When I got home from work, I opened my mail. The letter turned out to be a bombshell. I held in my hand an invitation to my 10-year high school reunion. It was a shock because I couldn't believe it had been 10 years. The first thing I did was to call my oldest and dearest friend, Maria. We had gone to high school together and we had been best friends.

Maria said that she had received her invitation in the mail, too. I told her that I was leaning against going. After all, why live in the past? I thought, but Maria convinced me that it would be a trip to see some of our old friends and to find out what had become of them. At the very least, we would get a chance to see each other and to talk about old times.

And, Maria said, Jeff McQuillan might be there. Ah, Jeff McQuillan. He was a senior when I was a sophomore, and I had a big crush on him. I thought he was so cute and he was smart, too. He was at the top of his class. He wasn't the class clown, but he had a great sense of humor and was voted most likely to succeed. He never gave me a second look, but I always made sure I sat next to him in class. I wonder what he's doing now and whether he'll be there. Hmm, maybe this reunion will be more fun than I thought.

### 0097 Checking Into a Hotel

I flew into Atlanta the afternoon before a big meeting. I hailed a taxi at the airport and told the driver the name of the hotel. I asked him how long it would take to get there. He said it would only be 20 minutes. I sat back and relaxed.

We got to the hotel and the doorman helped me take my luggage to the check-in desk, where I spoke with the front desk clerk.

***

Rob: Hi, I'm checking in. The last name is Rama.

Clerk: Yes, here is your reservation. You have a standard room reserved for two nights. Is that right?

Rob: Actually, no. It should be a suite. I had booked a non-smoking king.

Clerk: Oh, my mistake. The reservation is for a suite and it is a non-smoking room with a king bed. I'm sorry for the error.

Rob: That's okay. I'm here a little early. Is it possible to check in right now?

Clerk: Sure, that's no problem. May I have your credit card? We need a credit card on file for your room charges and incidentals.

Rob: Here it is.

Clerk: Okay, now if you could please verify the room rate here – initial next to the X and sign right here. How many keys will you need?

Rob: Oh, just one.

Clerk: Okay, you're all set. You're in room 1201. Take the elevators to the 12th floor and it will be on your left. Do you need any help with your bags?

Rob: No, I'm fine. Thanks.

Clerk: Enjoy your stay.

### 0098 Winter Weather

I grew up in Minnesota, where the summers are hot and humid and winters are bitterly cold. Living in Los Angeles now, it's sometimes hard to describe to people how winter weather can be in chillier climates. In L.A. most of the year, the weather is sunny, clear, and warm. In one of my favorite movies, LA Story, the weathercaster pre-recorded his weather forecasts because the weather was the same every day!

Well, that's an exaggeration, because even in L.A., it can sometimes be quite cool in the winter and some areas around the beaches can have dense fog and occasionally drizzling. But that's nothing compared to Minnesota. In winter, they get snow flurries and blizzards, when as much as 3 feet of snow can fall. As a kid, I would build snowmen and make angels on the ground. That part was fun but I also froze my buns off!

And, of course, one thing that Minnesota has a lot of in the wintertime is snow. Sometimes, we get so many inches of snow, we have to shovel and plow our way out of our houses. The worst is when there is freezing rain and sleet and the roads are slippery. Needless to say, there are a lot of fender benders on the road with this kind of weather. Luckily, Minnesota doesn't get any hurricanes that far north, but other parts of the country are hard hit by those every year.

Well, I have to say that it's nice not to have to scrape ice off my windshield in the mornings, but I do miss the white Christmases.

### 0099 Sitcoms and Game Shows

When I want to kick back and relax, I usually flip on the TV and see what's on. Primetime begins at 8:00 PM on the coasts in the United States, but there are plenty of reruns and shows in syndication between the time I get home from work at five and eight o’clock. I like to watch quiz shows like Jeopardy or Who Wants to be a Millionaire? I actually tried out once to be on Jeopardy, thinking I could be the next Ken Jennings! But I didn't pass the test. So much for trivia.

The national news is on at 6:30 in L.A., and there is lots of local news before and after that. Between six and seven there are Hollywood gossip shows like Access Hollywood and Entertainment Tonight, as well as some sitcoms. One of my favorites is Seinfeld, the ultimate comedy program about nothing. Of course, there are some old favorites, too, such as MASH and Friends. When I'm feeling really bored or really desperate‚ I'll turn on Wheel of Fortune and watch somebody buy a vowel.

### 0100 Making Unkind Comments

Yesterday, I was talking to an ex-colleague of mine who, frankly, has something of a big mouth. I bumped into him at the beach, where he was walking his dog. Anyway, as I was saying, he's the kind of guy that's always bad mouthing his co-workers. So he came up to me and said, "Hey, Jeff. Long time, no see. What've you been up to?" "Ah, not much, " I said. "Well, guess who I saw yesterday? John Robeson, the guy from accounting at Firth Industries. You remember him, the guy with big ears and and an ego to match." “It takes one to know one,” I thought, but I kept it to myself. "Oh, really? How interesting," I replied.

"Yeah, well, I hate to talk behind someone's back, but ever since he and I had that falling out last year, I've never really cared for the guy." "How come?" I asked. "Well, he's a bit of a backstabber, always trying to outdo the other guy." "I know what you mean," I said. I knew at this point it was time to make my exit, otherwise, this guy would go on about John Robeson for the next 10 minutes.

"What time do you have?" I asked him. "It's quarter after five." "Geez, already? Man, I've got to hit the road. I'm supposed to meet my brother at the pier in a few minutes. But, hey, it was sure good to see you again. You take care!" With that, I made my exit. I've got better things to do than to listen to him gripe all day.

### 0101 Returning a DVD Player

I bought a new DVD player last weekend. When I got home and hooked it up, I realized that it was defective. I trudged back to the store to return it.

Clerk: Next, please.

Jeff: Hi, I bought this DVD player last Saturday and I'd like to return it.

Clerk: What's the reason for the return?

Jeff: It's not working properly.

Clerk: What's the matter with it?

Jeff: Well, several things. First of all, the remote doesn't work.

Clerk: Did you put batteries in it?

Jeff: Yes, of course, but it still didn't work. I couldn't change any of the functions on the display. It also doesn't fast forward when I'm playing a DVD. It rewinds but it won't fast forward while the picture is playing. On top of that, I couldn't get the closed caption feature to work.

Clerk: Okay, I see. Anything else?

Jeff: Yes, as you can see, the casing scratches very easily. I just took it out of the box and put it on my entertainment unit and I got all of these scratches.

Clerk: Oh, are you sure you didn't scratch it with your keys or set some things on top of it?

Jeff: No, I'm sure.

Clerk: Well, I'm sure that it's just a problem with this one player. I've never seen this with any of the models made by this brand. Do you have the receipt?

Jeff: Yes, here it is.

Clerk: Do you want to exchange it or return it?

Jeff: I'd like to return it.

Clerk: Okay, how did you pay for it?

Jeff: With a credit card.

Clerk: Can I see your card? Okay, I'll credit it back to your credit card. Can you fill out this form with your name and phone number, and sign at the bottom?

Jeff: Sure.

Clerk: Great. Here's your credit card back and $95 has been credited to your credit card. Anything else I can help you with?

Jeff: Oh, there is one more thing. Can you tell me if you carry iPod Nanos?

### 0102 Wait-Listed for a Flight

I can't believe I made it into San Francisco, at long last! This morning, I went to the airport to catch my 10 a.m. flight. I got there early to go through security. The folks at the TSA can really slow things down sometimes. Since I had an electronic ticket, I didn't have to wait at the ticket counter to check in, but instead used a kiosk. I then went straight to the gate, but when I got there, I couldn't believe my eyes. The flight was delayed -- for two hours!

I decided to look at the flight monitors to see if there was an earlier flight to San Francisco. I thought maybe I could either switch to that flight or get wait-listed. I saw that there was another flight leaving in 40 minutes and so I bolted for the gate. When I got there, I got into the back of the long line. When I got to the front of the line, I asked the gate agent if I could get on that flight instead and she said I would be wait-listed. She said that I needed to stay in the gate area and wait for my name to be called if they have a seat available, so I waited, and waited, and waited.

The gate agent began calling out names over the PA system and guess what? The last name called was mine. What a relief! The last seat left on the plane was a middle seat and I usually prefer an aisle or window, but I was just happy to get on board. I didn't want my vacation to get delayed because of a late flight.

When the plane landed, I went out to the curb to catch a taxi to my hotel. I only had carry-on bags so I didn't need to wait in baggage claim. I was out of the airport and off on my vacation.

### 0103 Making a Sales Call

Last week, I was at a business luncheon and I met a woman named Dana Okri who was heading a new start up. I have been a sales rep for Eureka Corp. for three years now and our bread and butter is data management software. I told her briefly about our products over lunch and she had given me her card.

I decided to follow up with a call. I dialed her direct line and fortunately, I got a hold of her on the first try.

Dana: Hello, Dana Okri.

Kevin: Hello, Dana, this is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp. I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon.

Dana: Oh, yes. Hi. How are you?

Kevin: Great. Do you have a few minutes right now for me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company has to offer? It won't take long.

Dana: Actually, I'm really swamped right now and I'll be going into a meeting in a few minutes. Is there any literature you can send me?

Kevin: Oh, sure, I understand. I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company your size. Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions?

Dana: Let's do this. Since I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to read the material, why don't I give you a call if I have any questions. Now, I'm really sorry, but I have to get going to this meeting.

Kevin: No problem at all. I won't keep you any longer. I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there.

Dana: Sounds good.

Kevin: Thanks for your time.

Dana: No problem. Bye-bye.

### 0104 Bar Hopping

A bunch of my old college friends came into town for a few days and we went out last night, bar hopping until closing time. We started around 9 p.m. and were on our third bar when we closed it down. Some of us were starving and the rest of us were peckish so we decided to get a late-night snack. We didn't want fast food so we decided to try to find a 24-hour diner.

We passed on a chain restaurant and went instead to a dive near downtown. The six of us went in and we sat at the counter. Since the place was dead, we had it to ourselves. One of my friends, Paul, got pretty rowdy and the waitress had to tell him to chill out. He was pretty hammered so we had to keep an eye on him. He was a lightweight and didn't usually drink much, but he was bummed out about a fight he had had with his girlfriend and decided to get smashed. I felt sorry for the guy, especially since I knew that he would have a terrible hangover in the morning. I tried to get him to drink some coffee, but he just wanted to stay buzzed.

After we left the diner, I dropped everybody off at Paul’s, since I was the designated driver. They were all crashing at his place. I made my way home and fell into bed. It was good to see my old friends but I'm definitely getting too old to party like we did in college. As the old saying goes: The mind is willing, but the body is weak.

### 0105 Driving Directions

I was getting into my car at the mall when I noticed a man standing nearby with a map. He looked confused and I asked him if I could help. He looked up and was clearly relieved. He was from Houston, Texas, he told me, and he was visiting his daughter. She was at work that afternoon and he wanted to take the opportunity to buy her a present before she got back, but he wasn't accustomed to driving in L.A. and he got all turned around. His daughter lived near the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and he needed to find his way back.

I was familiar with that area so I gave him some directions:

"When you drive out of the mall, turn left and get into the far right lane. You need to get on the 10 freeway and the on-ramp will be on your right. Go about two blocks and you will see a sign that says 10W right after you cross under the bridge. Once you are on the freeway, look out for the exit for La Brea Avenue. Get off at that off-ramp and you will be heading north on La Brea. Go straight up La Brea, past Venice Boulevard, and keep your eyes out for Wilshire Boulevard. If you get to Beverly Boulevard, you've gone too far. A good landmark to look for is the big Samsung sign on the corner, at the intersection of La Brea and Wilshire, atop an office building. Make a left on Wilshire, going west. Go about six blocks and you'll see the museum on the right-hand side."

The man said that he knew his way from the museum and thanked me for the directions.

I was glad I could help. I don't envy anyone who has to drive the freeways in L.A. It's not for the faint of heart!

### 0106 High School Jobs

I got my first part-time job when I was 15, working at a car wash in the summertime. A friend of mine, Rob, worked there and got me the job. I think it paid $2.90 an hour, which I considered a fortune. There were no allowances in my family, so most of my brothers and sisters started working as soon as they could to get spending money. I hated working at the car wash, drying cars all day. After only about six weeks working there (though it seemed much longer), I up and quit one day. I felt badly about not giving a two-week notice, but I had it up to here with the job. Luckily, another friend of mine got me a job working at a nursing home, washing dishes in the kitchen. I started the day after my 16th birthday, qualifying me for a slightly higher minimum wage.

Life scrubbing pots and pans was no picnic, let me tell you. I lasted there for only three months, working after school and on weekends while trying to keep up with my homework in high school. My next job was much better: Making keys at a locksmith. The working conditions were much better and I had flexible hours around my school schedule. I stayed at that job for nearly seven years, right through my college years at the University of Minnesota. To this day I still know the names of all the common key blanks, but it doesn't come in handy very often!

### 0107 Going to the Dentist

I went to the dentist to get a check-up and cleaning. I showed up at the dentist's office a few minutes before 10. I gave the receptionist my name and told her that I had a 10 a.m. appointment. She said that the doctor was running a little late and that I should take a seat. After about 15 minutes, a dental assistant came out and told me to follow her. She led me to a room and told me to take a seat in the exam chair, and then she put a dental bib on me.

The dentist came into the room.

Dentist: Hello, how are you today? Here for your six month check-up?

Gary: I'm fine, Dr. Meecham. Yes, just a cleaning and check-up today.

Dentist: Oh, fine. Let's take a look.

She probed my teeth and checked my gums.

Dentist: Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose. We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted. Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them.

Gary: Okay, I'll do that, but my crown was just put on last year. Will my dental insurance cover the work?

Dentist: Since you had that done here, we'll take care of it. There won't be a charge. And your insurance should cover the work on the cavity. Now, I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see you soon for the other work.

Gary: Thanks, doctor.

The hygienist came into the room and had me rinse with mouthwash. She began her cleaning and finished by polishing my teeth. On my way out, I tried to make an appointment for the following week. Unfortunately, there were no appointments available for two weeks, and the time they had was an inconvenient one, but I said I'd manage. I have to say, going to the dentist can be a pain, in the mouth and in the butt.

### 0108 Asking Someone Out

I walked into the coffee room and saw that Brad was writing something on a piece of paper. When he saw me come in, he slipped the note out of sight.

Trisha: Hey, what's up?

Brad: Oh, nothing.

Trisha: What were you writing?

Brad: (Laugh) All right. You caught me in the act. I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out. I was just writing a note to put on her desk.

Trisha: You mean you're going to ask her out in a note? You big chicken!

Brad: I admit it. I'm a wuss. I just can't do it in person.

Trisha: But, you work with her every day.

Brad: That's different. When I'm working, I'm in a different frame of mind. But, when I even think about asking her out, I get tongue-tied. At least in a note, I can get the words out without turning beet red.

Trisha: You've dated a lot. What's so different about Diana?

Brad: Well, for one thing, she's gorgeous. She's so upbeat and sweet. Who doesn't like her? Oh, I don't know. All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together. But, what if I'm wrong? Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way. Oh forget it. This was a bad idea.

Trisha: Well, I guess you don't want this note, then.

Brad: What note?

Trisha: I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana. She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night.

Brad: You're kidding! I can't believe you've been standing there this entire time and didn't say anything.

Trisha: Sorry. What can I say? Now, do you want the note or what?

Brad: Yeah, I want the note.

Trisha: Have a great time tomorrow night.

Brad: Thanks. I plan on it.

### 0109 Being an Entrepreneur

I had lunch today with my friend Sam. She recently quit her job with a large company to strike out on her own. She has always been an entrepreneur in small ways, but she decided to start her own business. The start-up she launched provided technology consulting services for small- to medium-sized companies.

At first, she considered becoming partners with one or two of her co-workers. She wasn't sure if she could raise the seed money she needed for the start-up costs. But, she was able to raise the capital by taking on a silent partner, her uncle who had a lot of investment capital, but didn't want to be involved in the day-to-day operations of a business now that he's retired.

One way that Sam is able to cut down on overhead is to make this a home-based business. She converted her garage into an office where she and her employees could work. Since most of the work would be done on site at her client's office, she didn't need a lot of office space.

I asked Sam if she was nervous about quitting her job to start her own business. She said that it's a big risk, but that she was looking forward to the challenge. If she fails, she said, she can always audition for American Idol. Well, I thought, I've heard Sam sing. I really hope her business takes off!

### 0110 Hotel Reservations

I just finished a huge project at work and I needed some down time. I decided to take a short vacation. I liked the idea of a long weekend out of town. My friend Sara offered to let me crash at her place in San Francisco, but I decided to stay at a hotel instead. Sara has a couple of roommates and I thought it might be too crowded.

I called the toll-free reservation number for a major hotel chain. The reservation agent was very helpful, after I got through the long phone tree.

Agent: Dutton Hotels. How may I help you today?

Jeff: I wanted to check rates and availability for your San Francisco location.

Agent: Certainly, I can help you with that. Will that be the downtown or waterfront location?

Jeff: The waterfront location.

Agent: What date do you plan to check in?

Jeff: I’d like to check in on October 12th and check out the 15th.

Agent: Okay, let me see what we have. For how many?

Jeff: One. And, if possible, I’m looking for a non-smoking room.

Agent: Sure, we have a non-smoking queen with an ocean view for 189 dollars or a standard room with a courtyard view for 139 dollars a night.

Jeff: I’d like to book the standard room.

Agent: Okay, your last name?

Jeff: Rama.

Agent: And your first name?

Jeff: Jeff.

Agent: Okay, I have you booked in a standard, non-smoking queen, checking in on October 12th and departing the 15th. What major credit card would you like to use to guarantee the reservation?

Jeff: A Visa.

Agent: The number and expiration?

Jeff: It’s 7388-2424-3535-1818, and the expiration is 05/08.

Agent: Your confirmation number PD672. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Jeff: No, that’s all. Thanks.

Agent: Have a nice day, and thanks for calling Dutton Hotels.

### 0111 Last Minute Holiday Shopping

Every year, I tell myself that I won't procrastinate in doing my holiday shopping. And, every year, I end up with a shopping list as long as your arm and about 24 hours to get it all done. Waiting until the last minute means that I have to brave the crowds out doing their last minute shopping.

First, I have to find a place to park in the parking lot, which is always packed. Then, I have to fight off the bargain hunters who are there for the holiday markdowns. With so many shoppers, the shelves are usually a mess and a lot of items are out of stock. When I've finally picked out what I want to buy, there are usually long lines at the register. Just when I'm about to check out, I always remember that I've forgotten one last thing. It never fails!

When I get home with the presents, I have to wrap them. Hopefully, I haven't forgotten to get gift wrap, ribbons and bows, and holiday cards. By the time I'm finished, I'm exhausted and I feel like Scrooge. Ba humbug!

Why do I do this to myself every year? Next year, I'm starting my holiday shopping in September. Then again, I said that last year.

### 0112 Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa

The holidays in my family are very diverse. Our custom is to celebrate Christmas every year as a religious observance, complete with Advent wreathes and Midnight Mass. Most of my in-laws observe Christmas purely as a secular holiday, with the focus on exchanging gifts, stockings, a Christmas tree, and other traditional customs. There is a lot of listening to Christmas music‚ my favorites are the carols sung by Nat King Cole ‚ and sometimes even some eggnog. My nieces and nephews enjoy the day the most, especially when they get to open the gifts under the tree from Santa Claus.

One of my brother-in-laws is Jewish, and so he celebrates Hanukkah, the festival of lights, when he lights a candle each of the eight nights on the menorah. My niece gets a small gift each night of Hanukkah, and, of course, spins the dreidel. With both celebrations in the same family, we sometimes call it Chrismukkah.

But the holidays are no longer just Christmas and Hanukkah in the United States. More recently, there are some people who celebrate a new holiday, Kwanzaa. This is a mostly African- American event, with parades and other parties to highlight African-American heritage. Started here in Los Angeles, this celebration runs for 1 week after Christmas, and is a mostly secular celebration.

Whatever tradition you celebrate, December is always a festive time of year.

### 0113 New Year's Party

I walked into the office and saw Rob with his head down on his desk. I tapped him on the shoulder.

Christy: You look like you had a good New Year's.

Rob: Yeah, too good. I'm trying to catch up on sleep.

Christy: Oh yeah? What did you do?

Rob: I went to a New Year's party at the Key Club on the Sunset Strip with a few buddies of mine. The fireworks at midnight were great. I met this great girl there, too. Champagne was flowing everywhere and I had a great time.

Christy: Sounds like fun. What was the girl's name?

Rob: Uh, it was Rosa or Rebecca, or something.

Christy: I see you really got to know her well. But, I thought you and Vince were going to the Rose Bowl Parade.

Rob: Yeah, we did. After we left the Key Club, we changed and took our stuff down to the parade route. We managed to find a place to camp out. There were tons of people there already. We ended up striking up conversations with some out-of-towners from Cleveland, and a couple who knew the grand marshal for this year's parade.

Christy: How was the parade itself?

Rob: It was great, I think. I fell asleep half way through it, but the floats I saw were pretty amazing.

Christy: It sounds like you need a few days to recover.

Rob: Yeah, definitely. Wake me up when the boss comes in, will you?

Christy: Yeah, right. Hey, heads up. Here she comes.

### 0114 Writing a Thank You Note

Dear Jake,

I wanted to thank you for all of the help you've given me over the past several weeks. Being laid up with pneumonia really caught me off-guard, but you went above and beyond in taking care of me. Before I got sick, we had only known each other as neighbors and only for a short time. That's why it's so amazing that when I called you, you came running. You pulled out all the stops to help me in every way. You ran my errands, kept me company, and made sure I had everything I needed. Being on my own in L.A., I'm so grateful to have a good friend like you. You're truly one in a million.

Have a wonderful holiday and I'll see you when you get back.

Kate

### 0115 New Year's Resolution

This is the time of year when people make their New Year's resolutions. At the beginning of a new year, people take stock of their lives and decide to make some changes.

A lot of people want to get into shape. They vow to go to the health club and work out every day. Many people also decide to go on a diet. After overindulging at holiday meals, people feel the need to cut back and to shed some extra pounds. Many people also promise to quit smoking or drinking to live healthier lives.

Whatever resolution you make, don't forget the most important one: Promise not to have to make the same resolution next year.

### 0116 Holiday Travel

It's hard to avoid traveling over the holidays, but the experience I had last week really takes the cake.

I flew back to Tucson, Arizona to be with my wife's family, as we do every Christmas. I got to the airport an hour and a half before my flight, which I thought would be plenty of time. When I got there, though, I saw that the security line was out the door. Because it was the holidays, people were traveling with a lot of extra packages. It took twice as long as it normally would to get to the front of the line. When I finally got to the gate, I found out that my flight had been oversold. The gate agent was looking for people to voluntarily give up their seats for a later flight in exchange for a $100 travel voucher. If she didn't get enough volunteers, she would have to bump people from the flight. Luckily, several people took her up on the offer and the rest of us boarded.

What a hassle! I love the holidays, but I don't love holiday travel.

### 0117 Impressions of LA

I was talking to my new friend Nicole about the differences between New York City and Los Angeles. Nicole just relocated from New York, where she lived all her life, and I'm a native of L.A.

Dan: So, is L.A. all it's cracked up to be?

Nicole: Well, the stereotype in the movies is that L.A. is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people. I guess, in the back of my mind, that's what I expected.

Dan: And, is it what you found?

Nicole: Well, it is and it's not. The city of L.A. is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected. There are people here from all over the country and all over world, like New York. I've heard people say that in L.A., everyone is from somewhere else. That's partly true. So, I've met all kinds of people here. What I'm realizing is that the picture of L.A. that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city.

Dan: You're right. Life isn't always like the movies.

### 0118 Small Talk at a Business Lunch

James: Hello, are you Muriel Douglas?

Muriel: Yes, and you must be James. It's nice to meet you at long last.

James: Yes, you too. Thanks for agreeing to meet with us about the new account. My associate, Susan Kim, should be here any minute. Would you like something to drink while we're waiting?

Muriel: No, thanks. I'm fine. Did you have a nice holiday?

James: Yes, I did. My family and I went to Tahoe to ski and the weather was great. How about you?

Muriel: I stayed in L.A. and it was sunny the entire weekend. We spent most of the time at home, but we did go see King Kong on Christmas day.

James: How did you like it?

Muriel: It was better than I expected. But, you know, I think I would have enjoyed skiing in Tahoe even better. Do you go there often?

James: No, not much. My wife doesn't like to ski. She prefers vacationing where it's warmer, like Hawaii.

Muriel: I don't blame her. I really enjoyed it there when we went a few years ago. I'd like to go back sometime soon.

James: Yes, me too. Oh, here's Susan now. Let me introduce you.

### 0119 Bad Pickup Lines

My friend and I were at a restaurant waiting for our dates to arrive. We sat at the bar and tried to get the bartender's attention to order a couple of drinks.

My friend, Tanya, is very pretty. She is always being hit on by men. So, it was no surprise that five minutes after we sat down, a guy got up from the other side of the bar and walked over to us. He sat down next to Tanya.

He looked at both of us and said, "Hi, I saw you two beautiful ladies sitting by yourselves over here. Could I buy you two a drink?"

Tanya looked at me and rolled her eyes and said, "No, thanks. We're waiting for our boyfriends."

We both thought that he would take the hint and get lost, but he didn't.

Instead, he looked at Tanya and said, "Do you come here often?"

Tanya tried to ignore him, but he wouldn't give up.

He said, "You look like an angel. Does heaven know you've escaped?"

That pickup line was so lame that we almost burst out laughing. Luckily, we didn't need to keep a straight face for long. Our dates walked in and the guy left. Charlie, my date, apologized for keeping us waiting. I told him that it was no big deal. We had plenty of entertainment.

### 0120 Employee Performance Review

Don: So how did your end-of-the-year review go?

Becky: Oh, it was okay. I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative. He thinks that I need to start being more creative.

Don: Did he actually say that?

Becky: Well, not in so many words. But I know that productivity is a big issue for him. Oh, he said the usual things like "Keep up the good work" and "Thanks for your hard work," but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department. That, to me, means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing.

Don: Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said?

Becky: No, I don’t. Either I shape up or my job is on the line.

Don: Well, I think you may be overreacting. Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing.

Becky: Do you really think so?

Don: Yes, I do. If you ask around, other people will tell you the same thing.

Becky: Maybe you're right. Thanks, Don. I feel better.

Don: I'm glad to hear it.

### 0121 Cooking Dinner

I'm not a very good cook, but I decided to surprise my wife by making a three-course meal. I went to the supermarket to get the dessert, and I stopped by the farmer's market to get some fresh vegetables, my ingredients for the salad.

The meal would start with a salad. I washed the vegetables in the sink, chopped them up, and mixed them in a bowl with a light dressing. That was pretty easy.

The next course was going to be more difficult. The main dish would be salmon. I put the oil and the fish in the pan, but it was difficult to know when it was done, not underdone or overcooked.

The last part of the meal would be the dessert. I decided to buy a small chocolate cake. The meal turned out pretty well and my wife enjoyed it. After dinner, we went into the kitchen and saw all of the dirty dishes that needed washing. I realized that cooking isn't the hard part, it's the cleaning up!

### 0122 Packing Toiletries for a Trip

It was going to be my wife's 30th birthday, and I was surprising her with a trip to San Diego for the weekend. Since it was going to be a surprise, I needed to pack both of our bags before picking her up from work and hitting the road.

Packing my stuff was easy, of course. I knew that the hotel would have shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion, so I didn't pack any. I packed my wife’s brush, comb, hair dryer, nail clippers, and emery board. I made sure that I didn't forget any of her makeup: foundation, mascara, eye shadow, blush, and lipstick.

I had everything we needed for our little trip. I was sure my wife would be surprised, and I know she loves surprises!

### 0123 Pop and Jazz Music

Abby: Hey, what are you listening to?

Bill: Right now I'm listening to the Foo Fighters' latest album. There are some really good tracks on this CD, including their new single.

Abby: Let me see your iPod for a minute. It looks like you've got a ton of good stuff loaded up. I like Gwen Stefani, too, and what's this? Shakira? I had no idea you were a fan of hers.

Bill: I think she's a really talented singer and songwriter. And, well, she's hot, too.

Abby: Yeah, I bet. Let's see. You've got some great jazz and blues standards here, too. Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington, and Billie Holiday. This one is a live recording, and these are compilations. You've got their greatest hits and some bootleg stuff, too. I never knew you were such a jazz buff.

Bill: Yeah, I like all kinds of music. Now, where are you going with my iPod?

Abby: I thought I'd just borrow it for a little while.

Bill: Yeah, right. Hand it over. I've got to download my favorite podcast.

### 0124 Asking for Clarification in a Business Meeting.

I was negotiating a contract with a new business partner, and we had a meeting to clarify the terms.

Bill: If I understand the terms correctly, the length of the contract would be one year with a one-year option. Is that correct?

Ms. Samuels: Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training?

Bill: I was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms.

Ms. Samuels: Yes and no. Let me see if I can clarify that. The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months.

Bill: Could you elaborate on that?

Ms. Samuels: Sure. What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in writing.

Bill: Let me see if I have that right. This contract is for six months of training, but if it isn't cancelled, continues for another six months. Is that right?

Ms. Samuels: Yes, that's right.

Bill: Okay, that's clear enough. Let's move on to the other terms

### 0125 Moving

Edmundo: What are you doing?

Ruth: Oh, I'm packing. My lease is up at the end of the month and I'm moving to Vancouver for six months while my boyfriend is finishing his degree at the university.

Edmundo: Oh, wow. Are you moving yourself or are you using a moving company?

Ruth: I'm renting a U-Haul and doing it myself. I'm putting some of my furniture in storage since we plan to move back here after he graduates.

Edmundo: Can I help? Do you need me to forward your mail?

Ruth: Thanks for the offer. I've submitted a change-of-address form to the post office so I hope my mail will get forwarded automatically. One thing I have to remember to do is to shut off the utilities: gas, electricity, and phone‚ but I'll have two more weeks to do that.

Edmundo: Well, good luck in Vancouver. I don't envy you. I hate moving. Let me know if you need any help with those boxes.

Ruth: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

### 0126 Awards Show Season

It's that time of year again. It's award show season. No, I'm not talking about the Nobel Prizes. I'm talking about the entertainment awards. This is the time of year when the TV shows and movies are nominated as the best of the year. Celebrities get together at an award ceremony and the winners are announced. My favorites are the Emmy Awards for television, the Academy Awards for the movies, and the Grammy Awards for records. But, I'm up for almost any award show‚ The Golden Globes, the SAG Awards, even the People's Choice Awards.

For some people, the best part of watching the award shows is the pre-show. The celebrities arrive on the red carpet and are interviewed. Sometimes what they are wearing, made by the top designers and jewelers, gets more attention than anything they say. But, it's still fun to see all of the celebrities all in one place, and you never know what will come out of their mouths when they win ; better yet, when they lose.

### 0127 Answering Machine Messages

I got two tickets to a show at the last minute and I tried to find someone to go with me. First, I called Amanda. The phone rang and rang and then her answering machine picked up.

"Hi, I'm not in right now. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can."

Amanda wasn't home or she was screening her calls. I didn't want to leave a message and decided to try Celia. The phone rang about six times and then I heard,

"This is the voicemail for Celia . Leave me a message after the long beep. Or, you can try my cell phone at 213-555-1212. Have a nice day."

By this time, I was starting to feel discouraged. I didn't want to go to the show by myself, so I tried one last time. I called Leslie at work.

"Hello, you've reached the office of Leslie Munroe. I am in a meeting or with a client. I'm sorry to miss your call. Please stay on the line and leave a detailed message. I will return your call as soon as I can. Thank you for calling."

I decided to leave a message. Leslie called me right back and we made plans for the show. We had a great time.

### 0128 Hiring Contractors

My company decided that it was time to remodel our offices and I was put in charge of getting bids from contractors. The trouble was, I had heard horror stories from friends who did remodeling and I was worried about finding a company that would get the job done on time and under budget.

No doubt there are many honest contractors, but some of the people I talked to had experiences with shady companies. Some of them weren't on the level about being able to meet deadlines and some tried to get away with murder when they billed for a job. It was important that I found a company that was on the up and up.

I got bids from six companies and checked all of their references. In the end, I picked a company that had done work for one of the biggest companies in the city. They seemed to be the best and our company hired them. I have my fingers crossed that everything will go smoothly.

### 0129 A Flaky Friend

Shawn: What's the matter? You look like you're about to blow your lid.

Rick: Yeah, let's just say I'm not happy.

Shawn: That's putting it lightly. What's up?

Rick: My friend Steve was supposed to come by here after work to give me a ride home. I lent him my car so he could take his girlfriend out for the day. I've been waiting 45 minutes and he's a no-show. I should have known better than to count on a flake like him.

Shawn: Maybe something came up. Have you tried calling him on his cell phone?

Rick: Yeah, I have and there's no answer. I can't believe he's left me high and dry.

Shawn: Tell you what. I'm almost done with my report. If you can wait another 15 minutes, I'll give you a lift home.

Rick: Really? That would be great.

Shawn: It's no big deal. But, I definitely don't want to be there when you find Steve.

### 0130 Allergic to Cats

When I was little, we had a family pet. His name was Jupiter and he was a kitten. I wanted a cat more than anything else, and finally, my parents gave in and said that we could have one. We went to the pound and saw dozens of cats of different breeds. We went from cage to cage until we saw a little kitten at the back of one of the cages. He looked scared, but when I picked him up, he wouldn't stop licking my hand and I knew he was the one we would bring home.

When we got Jupiter home, I played with him all day. What I noticed when I played with him was that I would sneeze a lot and I started getting hives on my arm. My nose would also be runny and my eyes would water. I tried to hide these symptoms from my mother, but she noticed them eventually and told me that I was allergic to cats! Even worse, we couldn't keep Jupiter! That was a tragic day in my young life. I thought I would never recover.

Then, a lucky thing happened. Our neighbor down the street was willing to adopt Jupiter and I was able to visit him all the time, as long as I didn't get too close. In the end, it wasn't such a terrible tragedy after all.

### 0131 Sharing an Apartment

I've shared a two-bedroom, two- bath apartment with my roommate for two years. He was moving to Austin and I posted a "roommate wanted" ad in the local newspaper. I got a few calls, a couple from some very weird people. Finally, I got a call from Andrew. He seemed normal on the phone and we agreed he would stop by today to see the apartment.

When he got there, I showed him around. The apartment has a pretty large living room with a large couch and TV. It doesn't have a dining room, but it does have an eat-in kitchen. My room is the master bedroom with a connecting bathroom. My roommate's room was the guest room with the bathroom in the hall.

I told Andrew that he could use any of the furniture that my roommate was leaving behind. He was taking his bed and dresser, but he planned to leave his desk in the bedroom. I also told him that he could use any of the appliances‚ the refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker.

Andrew said he liked the place and we agreed on the rent and to split the utilities. It was settled. He would move in next month. What a relief I didn't have to talk to any more weird people!

### 0132 Getting Through on the Phone.

I have been trying to get a meeting with the CEO of Medofact to talk about a partnership between our company and theirs. But I've had a hard time trying to get through on the phone.

First, there was the phone tree. I had to go through three menus before I got the option to speak to an operator. Even after I got through, I got the run around from the receptionist.

Receptionist: Medofact Limited. How may I direct your call?

Thomas: I would like to speak to Maureen Kennedy.

Receptionist: Please hold while I connect you with Ms. Kennedy's office. (Pause)

Secretary: Maureen Kennedy's office. How may I help you?

Thomas: Good afternoon. I am Thomas Guarini calling from Livatect. I would like to set up a meeting with Ms. Kennedy.

Secretary: Will Ms Kennedy know the subject of the meeting?

Thomas: Well, I would like to speak to her about a possible partnership.

Secretary: May I put you on hold for one moment?

Thomas: Yes, certainly. (I was on hold for a long time.)

Secretary: Mr. Guarini, I'm afraid Ms. Kennedy is traveling on business the next two weeks. Would you like to call back?

Thomas: Sure, I'll check back in a couple of weeks. Thanks for your help.

Secretary: It's my pleasure. Have a nice day.

Thomas: Thanks. You too!

I guess I'll keep trying.

### 0133 Going to a Wedding

I got an invitation in the mail last month that really surprised me. My friend Ulrich was getting married! We went to college together and he always said that he’d never get married. I guess he found his dream girl in the end.

The church wedding was going to be at 3 p.m. and the reception would start at 7 p.m. at the reception hall.

I arrived at the church shortly before 3 p.m. and one of the ushers asked me if I was a friend of the bride or the groom. I told him that I was a friend of the groom and he sat me on the left side of the church. I saw Ulrich standing near the front of the church with the best man, and a few minutes later, the pianist started playing the wedding march. The flower girl and ring bearer walked down the aisle, followed by the bridesmaid. Then, the bride appeared wearing a beautiful wedding dress, walking with her father who was giving her away. The bride and groom exchanged vows and they were married. It was a simple and traditional ceremony.

At the reception, there was a lot of champagne. The best man made a toast that really embarrassed Ulrich, but it was all in good fun. I got a chance to talk to Ulrich and he seemed really happy. In fact, he was trying to set me up with the bridesmaid. I guess it's true. All married people want to get all of their friends married. We'll see about that!

### 0134 Dating Someone's Ex

Marco: Hello.

Claudia: Hey, Marco? It's Claudia. Got a minute?

Marco: Sure. What's up?

Claudia: I'm just wondering what's going on with you and Beth. Are you guys still going out?

Marco: We went out for a while, but we never got serious. Why all the questions? Are you interested in Beth?

Claudia: (Laughs) No, I'm not interested but Shane is. He's been asking me about you guys. He wants to ask her out but he didn't know whether you guys were still together, or how you’d feel about him asking out your ex.

Marco: Why didn't he just ask me? Beth and I were casual and we haven't seen each other in months. He should go for it.

Claudia: Okay, I'll tell him. So, if you're not going out with Beth, who's the new girl?

Marco: Wouldn't you like to know. Actually, I've been seeing a great girl. I'm bringing her to the party on Saturday. You'll meet her then.

Claudia: Great. I'm bringing Lenny so you'll get to meet him, too. See you Saturday.

Marco: See ya!

### 0135 Scheduling a Meeting

I needed to schedule a meeting for the three departments involved in a new project. I called each one to find a date that would work for all three of us.

Bruno: So, Nicola, would the day after tomorrow work for you?

Nicola: No, I'll be out of the office all day. Could we do it early next week or a week from today?

Bruno: I was hoping to schedule it as soon as possible. How about the end of this week?

Nicola: Well, I think that's okay. We could meet late Thursday or Friday. I'm free Thursday from 3 to 5, and on Friday from 10 to 1.

Bruno: Okay. Let me talk to Kumi and I'll let you know.

.

Bruno: Hi Kumi, can you make a meeting with Nicola and me this Thursday or Friday?

Kumi: Oh, I wish I could but I'll be in the Boise office starting tomorrow. How about the following week?

Bruno: I think we can do it early next week. Would Monday at 10 work for you?

Kumi: Sure, that's fine.

Bruno: Let me check with Nicola. You know, I think this would be much easier on email. I'll send Nicola a note and we can confirm on email.

Kumi: Okay, I'll look for your email.

You know, sometimes, I think scheduling a meeting is the hardest part of actually having a meeting!

### 0136 Having a Baby

Patrick: Hey, congratulations! I just heard that you're expecting. How far along are you?

Cindy: Thanks. I'm four and a half months pregnant. It feels like it! I feel huge.

Patrick: You don't look it. I bet Carlos is excited. Do you know yet if it's a boy or a girl?

Cindy: No, we don’t. Not yet. We should be able to find out at my next ultrasound. I don't care what sex the baby is as long as it's healthy. Carlos is really excited about the baby. He has been going with me to every prenatal appointment and we'll be taking a Lamaze class together soon.

Patrick: How was your first trimester? When my wife had our daughter, she had a lot of morning sickness.

Cindy: Oh, it was horrible! I was nauseous all the time, but I'm better now. Did your wife have a natural delivery or a cesarean?

Patrick: She had a natural delivery, but she was in labor for 12 hours! I was in the delivery room the entire time and wish I had an epidural, too.

Cindy: Twelve hours! I can't imagine doing that.

Patrick: Don't think about it. I'm sure you'll have an easy delivery. Let me know when the baby shower will be.

Cindy: Thanks. I will.

### 0137 Meeting an Out of Town Friend.

Lucy: Hey Jeff, have you met my friend?

Jeff: No, I don't think I have.

Lucy: Well, this is my oldest and best friend, Marlene. She's visiting from out of town.

Jeff: Hi, I'm Jeff.

Marlene: Hi, it's nice meeting you.

Jeff: How long do you plan to be in town?

Marlene: I'm here for the long weekend, staying with Lucy. We're doing some catching up and I'm getting a break from work.

Jeff: Oh, what line of work are you in? Are you in the same field as Lucy?

Marlene: No, I'm in medicine. I'm a doctor, actually, a pediatrician. I enjoy the work, but it's nice to get away for a few days. What kind of work do you do?

Jeff: I work in the education field, but what I really want to do is to become a professional singer.

Lucy: Jeff has a great voice. He sounds exactly like Frank Sinatra.

Marlene: Really?

Jeff: No, she's just kidding and Lucy knows that I can't sing. We went to a karaoke bar once and people actually offered me money NOT to sing.

Lucy: That was a lot of fun. We should do that again sometime.

Jeff: Sure, anytime. Oh, I'd better go. It was nice meeting you Marlene, and Lucy, I'll talk to you next week.

Marlene: Nice to meet you, too.

Lucy: Okay, later.

### 0138 Hotel Tour Desk

Sam: Hi, is this where I can get information on tours?

Nan: Yes, I can help you with that. What type of tour are you thinking about? There are some great city tours that are half-day or full- day.

Sam: You know, we've explored the city a lot since we've been here. I was actually thinking of a side trip.

Nan: Oh, sure. We have excursions to nearby attractions. There are one-day trips or two-day overnight trips, depending on which one you pick.

Sam: I think I'm interested in a hiking trip to the mountains. I'm big on nature. Are the overnight trips expensive?

Nan: Not at all. They are very moderately priced, starting at $120 and up. Here's a brochure on the three hiking tours that are available. All three are guided tours, and meals and transportation are included.

Sam: Do I need to book ahead?

Nan: Yes, this company requires that you make a reservation 24 hours ahead.

Sam: Great. I'll take a look at the brochure. Can I book that here at the hotel tour desk, or do I call the company directly?

Nan: I can book that for you. Just stop by when you've made a decision and I'll take care of it for you.

Sam: That's great. Thanks a lot for your help.

Nan: It's my pleasure. Let me know if you have any questions.

Sam: I will. Thanks.

### 0139 Job Layoffs

Phillip: So, have you heard the news?

Mary: No, what's up?

Phillip: I just heard that the company is planning to lay off 20 percent of the employees in the next two months.

Mary: You're kidding! I knew they were looking for some way to cut costs with the lower profits this quarter, but I didn't think that they would start laying people off.

Phillip: Yeah, it's hard to believe. That'll be hundreds of people losing their jobs. It's not just the salary. It means losing benefits, too. You know, I hope it's not going to be Sebastian. With three kids and a wife who's sick, that would really be a blow.

Mary: When will we know who's getting axed?

Phillip: I don't know if we'll get any warning. We might just get a pink slip on a Friday afternoon. Well, I'm going to start job hunting right now.

Mary: That's a good idea. The first thing I'm going to do is to call all of my friends and business contacts to let them know I'm on the market. Hopefully, I'll get a line on something soon. Thanks for letting me know.

Phillip: Sure. If I hear anything else, I'll let you know.

Mary: Thanks. I'll do the same.

### 0140 Buying on the Internet

It's true that I don't like shopping. When I want to buy something, I do it online. I like buying on the Internet because I can easily do some comparison shopping and find the best price. It's easy, too.

Last week I wanted to buy some new headphones. I did a search and found a pair on sale at a store in New Jersey. I read the product description and knew that this was the right one. I added it to my shopping cart and I was ready to check out. The screen showed that I had one item in my basket and that it was in stock. I had a choice of shipping and I picked standard shipping for $5.95, rather than the expedited shipping for $12.95. I clicked the "continue" button and filled in my shipping address and my billing address. Then, it took me to the payment screen and I typed in my credit card number and expiration date. I clicked the "Purchase" button and I was done. I got a confirmation page with a tracking number. I checked the next day and it showed that my item had already been shipped.

Buying on the Internet is perfect for someone like me. Now, if only finding a girlfriend was just that easy.

### 0141 A Brainstorming Session

Judy: I've called this meeting so we can brainstorm some fundraising ideas. As you know, we're in danger of closing. Any thoughts?

Stan: I thought that Juan was working on getting donors.

Judy: He is, but we can't count on that coming through.

Dominique: How much do we need to raise? What's a ballpark figure?

Judy: We need at least $50,000 for next year.

Dominique: That's a lot of money, but I think we'll come up with something. How about a benefit performance?

Stan: That sounds promising. Who can we get to perform?

Judy: It would be great to get someone like Barry Manilow.

Dominique: I think we're shooting too high. I was thinking more like a local band or comedy group.

Stan: I've got it. My brother works for The Improv. He knows a lot of comedians from this area. Maybe we can get a few of them to perform.

Dominique: That would be great.

Judy: I like how this is shaping up. We're out of time, but let's meet again on Friday to hammer out the details. Thanks everybody.

### 0142 At a Nightclub

My friend Sabrina and I decided to go out dancing last weekend. We went to a club called the Fine Line and when we got there, there was a long line outside. That's one thing I hate about L.A. clubs. The hottest ones have long lines and it's hard to get in unless you're on the VIP list. Sometimes, the bouncer will pick cute girls out of line and let them in.

Sabrina always gets attention when we go out together and the bouncer noticed her right away. We paid the cover charge and got our wristbands.

The first thing we did was to head over to the bar.

Andrea: The music is pretty good. Hey, is that Jeff on the dance floor over there? He's so hot.

Sabrina: Where? Over there by the stage? Let's go see.

Jeff: Hey, did you guys just get here?

Sabrina: Yeah. Who are you here with?

Jeff: The DJ is a friend of mine. I came with him and some of his friends. We have a private room in back. Do you guys want to come check it out?

Andrea: Sure.

Sabrina: Definitely.

### 0143 Fighting a Parking Ticket

Mindy: Hey, where are you going?

Eric: I'm going to traffic court. I got a parking ticket and I'm going to fight it.

Mindy: How much was the fine?

Eric: It was only $40. But it's not the money. It's the principle of the thing.

Mindy: Why? Weren't you parked illegally?

Eric: No, I wasn’t. The street I live on has metered parking from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. After 6, you can park there with a permit. Well, I parked my car at 7:30 PM and I have a permit. But, I still got a ticket.

Mindy: Did you display the permit clearly? It isn't expired, is it?

Eric: Yeah, it's clearly displayed and it's good until June 2007.

Mindy: Well, it sounds like you have a good case. Are you representing yourself or did you hire a lawyer?

Eric: I'm going there by myself. Wish me luck.

Mindy: Good luck. If the judge locks you away, I promise to visit you in jail.

Eric: Thanks a lot. I'll remember that.

### 0144 Who Pays?

David: Hey, Sally. Can I run something by you?

Sally: Sure, what's up?

David: Well, a friend of a friend wanted some help with her taxes and we agreed that we would talk about it over dinner. At the end of the night, when the check came, she expected me to pay! It was really awkward. It wasn't a date and I was doing her a favor! Am I crazy or was she taking advantage of me?

Sally: It definitely sounds like she took advantage of your generosity. If she was asking a favor, she should have paid. No question.

David: The thing is, I thought she was really pretty and I wanted to ask her out after I met her. But, now I'm not sure.

Sally: Well, I think that unless you asked her out, you shouldn't have to pay for her. And, these days, a lot of people go Dutch even if one person asks the other. Based on what happened the other night, I'd stay away from this woman. That is, unless you don't mind being her sugar daddy.

David: Yeah, right. I'm too broke to be anybody's sugar daddy, even if I wanted to. I think you're right. That will be the last I see of her.

Script by Dr. Lucy Tse

### 0145 The Big Game

On my way home from class, I ran into Cara, a schoolmate that I have not seen in a few months. I stopped to say hi to her.

Mark: Hey, Cara! How's everything? Long time no see.

Cara: Yeah! It's been a while. I'm doing alright. How about you?

Mark: Great! I'm excited about the Big Game this weekend. Are you going?

Cara: Uh, no. What Big Game?

Mark: Are you kidding? This is the biggest football game of the season! And we're playing against one of the best teams in the state, so it's going to be really exciting.

Cara: Wow, that sounds like fun! Who are you going with?

Mark: A big group of friends. Hey, you know what? One of my friends has to go out of town this weekend and he won't be able to make it to the game, so I have an extra ticket. You want to join us?

Cara: Sure, I would love to go! I've never been to one of our school's football games before.

Mark: Awesome! There's a bus picking students up in front of the dorms at 1pm. Meet us there at 12:30.

Cara: Sounds like a plan! Thanks for giving me the extra ticket. I'll see you Saturday.

Mark: Alright, see ya!

### 0146 Suggestions at Work

Our company has been growing very quickly and I was put in charge of reorganizing our office space to accommodate several new employees. I asked my co-worker, Petra, for her advice.

Fernando: I was thinking of dividing up two of the larger offices into four smaller offices. What do you think about that?

Petra: Well, it seems to me that doing that would only solve part of the problem. Have you considered converting the conference room into offices?

Fernando: I'm not sure that will work. We don't have another meeting space if we do that. What are your thoughts on turning the coffee room into one large office with cubicles?

Petra: In my opinion, that's not going to be a very popular solution.

Fernando: The way I see it, there are no easy solutions and that may be the best one. Do you have any other suggestions?

Petra: No, none that would really work. In my opinion, the only solution is to divide up the executive offices. But, I know, I know. That's not going to happen. My suggestion is to ask a few more of the old employees. Maybe they'll think of something.

Fernando: I think you're right. It's not going to be an easy decision and I can use all the help I can get.

### 0147 Reading and Watching the News

I'm a news junkie. I like to read two newspapers every day. I don't just look at the headlines. I read most of the stories. I like the political news, the business news, the editorials, and the entertainment news. The only things I don't usually read are the sports pages and the classifieds.

I also try to catch the local TV news each day. I like to watch Channel 4 for the news reporting, but I like the weather report on Channel 9 mainly because the reporter is not only good, she's beautiful! For the national news, I like all three of the network anchors, so it doesn't matter which one I catch.

On top of that, I like to read a newsmagazine each week. I like the long feature stories that give more in-depth coverage of that week's top stories.

So, when I said I was a news junkie, I wasn't joking. When I travel to other countries, the first thing I do is look for an English-language newspaper. Then, I can relax!

### 0148 Paying the Bills

Grace: Did you already pay the bills for this month?

Will: No, I haven't gotten around to it yet. Why?

Grace: We got a late notice from the credit card company. The notice says that they haven't received the payment yet and it's past the due date. We are being charged a late fee plus a finance charge of 15%.

Will: Let me see that. That can't be right. I paid the minimum payment on the last bill. I better call and talk to customer service tomorrow. I'm sure it's a mix-up.

Grace: I really hope so. The last time we were late with the payment, I tried calling them and telling them that the check was in the mail, but they didn't buy it.

Will: That's different. Don't worry about it. I'm sure I'll get it straightened out. Worse comes to worst, we're only a month late. They won't send the collection agency after us.

Grace: I know I can count on you to take care of it. I just don't want this late payment to affect our credit rating.

Will: Leave it to me. I'll take care of it on Monday. It's as good as done.

### 0149 Watching Sports on TV

Laura: Oh, I didn't think I’d make it home in time for the game.

Jun: What game?

Laura: The playoffs! Turn on the TV. I hope it's still in the first quarter. It is! Who's winning? What's the score?

Jun: I don't know. You know I don't watch sports. Whoa! That was a great shot. Did you see that?

Laura: No, what happened? Maybe they'll show it again on instant replay. I wonder who the coach put in for the starting lineup.

Jun: Geez. I think there's a player down on the court.

Laura: It looks like he's walking off the court. He can't be hurt too badly.

Jun: Look! They're putting your favorite player in. Oh, what a play!

Laura: Wait a second. I thought you didn't watch sports.

Jun: I was never a sports fan before I met you. I think you're a bad influence on me.

Laura: Yes, very bad. Now, stop hogging the couch and pass the chips.

### 0150 Volunteer Work

Some people say that it's civic duty to "give back" to your community. That's true, but for me, I want to do some volunteer work so that I can feel useful. I've been working at the same job for years and it's not at all rewarding. Yes, I make good money, but I never feel like I'm doing any good in the world.

When I was in college, I had dreams of changing the world. I wanted to work in a non- profit organization that did relief work, that helped women and children in need, or that had an impact on public policy. I've begun to think again about those dreams and thought I might take the first step of doing some volunteering. Then, I can see if I like that kind of work and make some hard decisions.

I called an organization that helped homeless children. I told them about my education and experience, and they said they could use someone like me to do some tutoring. I filled out an application and was fingerprinted for a background check. A few weeks later, I met my student and I tutored her for the first time. It was a great experience. I wish I had done it earlier!

### 0151 Eating at a Buffet

I love eating at all-you-can-eat buffets. It doesn't matter what kind of food it is, I'm up for it.

Last week, I went to a high-end seafood buffet with my friends. We walked in and the hostess seated us at a table. She asked if we wanted to order any drinks. Drinks other than water are not included in the price.

I got up and got a plate. I went over to the soup and salad station first and then over to the hot food. They had a carving station and made-to-order omelets. They also had a great dessert table, but I wasn't ready for that yet. I sat down, ate, and grabbed a new plate for the second round. This time, I went for the seafood. I loaded up my plate and sat down again. After two more trips to the buffet, I was ready for dessert. I got a little of everything. I was so stuffed, I couldn't eat another bite.

I really enjoyed the meal. I like being able to serve myself. Some people don't like buffets unless they're very high-end. Not me. Give me any high-end or low-end buffet and I'm perfectly happy.

### 0152 Planning a Company Retreat

Sharon: So, Leo, how are the plans coming along for the company retreat?

Leo: I've made most of the arrangements and I think it's going well. I'm planning to send out information about the two-day event to the managers at the end of this week.

Sharon: What do you have set up for the opening day? There's normally a welcome dinner.

Leo: That's what I have arranged. Then, for the following day, I've lined up several speakers and panels to talk about productivity, teamwork, and the other topics we discussed.

Sharon: Good. What about recreation? We don't want it to be all work and no play.

Leo: The hotel where we're holding the retreat this year has golf and water sports. I don't think the managers will be bored.

Sharon: Well, it sounds like you have it all under control. Keep up the good work.

Leo: Thanks.

### 0153 A Complaint Letter to a Tour Company

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing regarding a tour that my wife and I took with your company on February 26, 2006. The brochure stated that we would see some of the most interesting sights of the city. Since we had visited the city before, we looked forward to seeing some new attractions.

On the morning of February 26, our tour guide picked us up in a small van. It did not look like any tour bus I had ever seen. Our tour guide drove us to the waterfront area and said that we could explore the area on our own. The tour guide said that he had to leave for a short time to arrange for our lunch.

By the time the tour guide came back, three hours had gone by! I was very angry and confronted him. I told him that this was the worst tour I had ever been on.

I am asking for a complete refund of the price of the tour. Please send a check to the address above for $150.00 at your earliest convenience. I have enclosed a copy of the receipt for the tour.

Sincerely,

Kanye East

### 0154 Using Email

One of the first things I do each morning is to check my email. I open the email program on my computer and I check for new messages. It usually takes only a few seconds for my new messages to download from the server into my inbox unless there’s a large attachment. I can then click onto each new message to read it.

I reply to messages or forward them to someone else. The important messages I save by putting them into one of my mailboxes. The unimportant ones I just delete.

I really hate getting spam. Luckily, my email program allows me to set up filters so that spam messages are put into a separate mailbox automatically. I usually scan the messages to make sure real messages weren’t put into the mailbox by mistake and then I put them in the trash.

I don’t know what I would do without email, but I’m constantly checking for new messages. I’m not sure if it’s a blessing or a curse. I suppose it’s both.

### 0155 A Good Review of a Play

I invited Bruce to a play at the Mark Taper Forum and we got there a little early. We handed our tickets to the woman at the door and found our seats.

Megan: Im glad we got here early to find our seats. I know that this is a sold out performance.

Bruce: The cast is supposed to be really good. I read a rave review of the play in the paper last week. The review said that the leads are perfectly cast and the directing is inspired. Federica saw it a couple of weeks ago and she said that the staging and the costumes were really something to see.

Megan: Im really glad. The last time I came to a play at this theater, it was a bomb. The two lead actors werent up to their parts and the whole production was amateur. It closed early after only two weeks.

Bruce: That wont happen with this play. Hey, theyre dimming the lights. The curtain should be going up any minute

### 0156 Rumors and Secrets

Jack: So, what do you think of the new guy?

Kate: Oh, you mean Bernard? He’s okay, I guess. Why?

Jack: Well, I heard that he left his last company under mysterious circumstances. I tried to find out more from Libby, but she was very hush-hush about it.

Kate: I’m not surprised. Libby doesn’t like to gossip, unlike some people…

Jack: I’m not gossiping. I just like to know more about the people I work with.

Kate: Okay, but don’t start any rumors. Bernard seems nice and I think we should give him a chance.

Jack: Don’t worry. I’ll cut him some slack, but I want to know what skeletons are in his closet.

Kate: Take it from me. You won’t find any dirty little secrets and you may make an enemy of Bernard in the process.

Jack: You’re probably right but I wonder what Nathan knows…

### 0157 Taking the Bus in Los Angeles

I just moved to L.A. and don’t have a car. Everybody says that you can’t get around this city without one, but I wanted to prove them wrong.

I asked my neighbor to take me to the downtown bus station so I could try taking the bus home. She thought I was crazy, but gave me a ride. When I got there, I went inside and got a bus schedule. I looked at the map and figured out that I needed to take three buses to get home. The fare was $1.75 per ride and I could buy a single ticket, a booklet of 20, or a bus pass. I would need transfers, too, to change buses.

I took my map and went outside to wait at the bus stop for the Number 8 bus. Soon, it pulled up and I got on. I gave my ticket to the bus driver and took a seat. At the stop where I needed to get off, I rang the bell, the bus stopped, and I got off. I waited for the next bus. I waited and waited. A man who was also waiting for the Number 14 bus said that it wasn’t unusual for the bus to be delayed. It finally got there and I found out that the bus had broken down along the route and they had to get another bus to take its place. By this time, I was getting pretty tired. Maybe getting a car in L.A. wasn’t such a bad idea.

### 0158 Shopping with My Wife

One thing I dread more than anything else is going clothes shopping with my wife. It’s not that I don’t like helping her buy new clothes. It’s just that I have no fashion sense.

My wife always asks me, “What do you think of this one?” and I always answer with something like: “That’s nice” or “That looks good on you.” That usually satisfies her, but sometimes I get harder questions like, “Which one looks better, this one or the other one?” It’s a hard question to answer because whichever one I pick, she will follow up with the question I dread the most: “Why?”

The truth is, I don’t know why. I don’t know if it’s because of the color, the cut, the hemline, or the fit. I might have an idea, but I can’t put it into words.

One question I do know the answer to, though, is: “Do I look fat in this?” The answer to THAT question is always, always, “No!”

### 0159 Moonlighting

Robert: You look exhausted. You must have been out late last night having fun.

Muriel: I wish. I’ve actually started moonlighting. I’ve decided to go back to school and need the extra money to make ends meet.

Robert: Good for you. That’s great. Where are you moonlighting?

Muriel: I’m working at the university library. At that time of night, it’s pretty dead. When there are no students around, I can use the time to study. It works out pretty well, except for the hours.

Robert: Oh, yeah? What are they?

Muriel: My work schedule is pretty good, actually. I work three days a week: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. But my hours are 7 to midnight. By the time I get home, I’m dead tired.

Robert: No wonder you look beat. Here, have some more coffee.

Muriel: Thanks. I just hope I don’t fall asleep in the morning meeting.

Robert: It’s okay. No one will notice.

Muriel: Thanks a lot!

Robert: Don’t mention it.

### 0160 A Flirt

Elaine: You look happy.

Jerry: Me? Oh, I was just talking to Ling.

Elaine: Oh, no wonder! You better watch out. She’s a big flirt.

Jerry: What do you mean?

Elaine: Did she make eyes at you and whisper sweet nothings in your ear?

Jerry: Well, yes, she said she’d never met anybody like me before, and by her body language, I think she was serious.

Elaine: Then she’s still using the same old line that she used with Kramer. She had him wrapped around her little finger.

Jerry: Give me a little credit. I know when I’m being snowed and when a girl is really interested in me.

Elaine: I hope you’re right, but she’s quite the heartbreaker. I just don’t want you to get hurt.

Jerry: Thanks, but I think I can take care of myself.

Elaine: Okay. Suit yourself.

### 0161 A Bad Boss

Tom: I wonder how much longer we’ll have to put up with Dennis. He is the most incompetent boss I’ve ever worked for.

Katie: He’s not that bad, is he? I don’t have much contact with him.

Tom: Are you kidding? He’s always sleeping on the job. The other day, he was supposed to keep an eye on the supervisors visiting from Salt Lake City. Instead, I heard that he went to a baseball game and the supervisors ended up stranded at the downtown office.

Katie: It’s hard to believe that he’d fall down on the job like that.

Tom: It’s not only that. He’s always passing the buck. Every time something goes wrong at the factory, he blames everyone but himself.

Katie: If he’s as bad as you say he is, he must be on his way out. But, you know what they say, “Better the devil you know, than the devil you don’t.”

Tom: Yeah, I know, but I’m willing to take my chances.

### 0162 Training a New Employee

Even though, I’ve only been on the job for six months, my manager asked me to train the new hire. She was starting today and when she arrived, we got down to business.

Akira: So, the first thing I’ll do is to give you a run down of the duties of the job. Your main responsibilities will be to ensure that the reports are finished each week, make any adjustments that need to be made, and distribute them to each department. Is that clear so far?

Frances: Sure. That seems pretty straightforward. Who do I report to?

Akira: Your immediate supervisor is Ida Funck. We all work under her in this department. Okay, here’s the employee manual. Make sure you read it.

Frances: Great. Thanks. Now, when do I get a break?

Akira: A break? You’ve only been here a half an hour.

Frances: Has it been that long? I need some coffee.

Needless to say, it was a very, very long day.

### 0163 Saving and Spending Money

In my family, there are penny- pinchers and spendthrifts, and everything in between. My brother Frank has the reputation for being stingy with money. He likes to save up and only spend when he has to. I bet he has a lot stashed away. He's careful with money but he does spend it when he thinks it's necessary, and his wife and kids are very comfortable.

On the other hand, my brother Jack is known as a spendthrift. It's not that he's a big spender or a high roller, it's just that he's not very careful with money, and doesn't think it's that important. When he has it, he doesn't think twice about spending it. With his friends, he's generous to a fault. So, what am I? A penny-pincher or a spendthrift? I guess I’m a little of both. It depends on who’s asking, and how much they want to borrow.

### 0164 Seeing a Specialist

I went to see my doctor because I had a nagging pain in my leg. After he examined me and did some routine tests, he suggested that I go see a specialist. I made an appointment with Dr. Slope.

Dr. Slope: Good morning! How are you today?

Simon: I'm fine, Dr. Slope. My GP, Dr. Harding, referred me to you. He thought that you might be able to diagnose the problem with my leg.

Dr. Slope: Well, let's take a look. Hmm, I want to order some tests, but I think you may need surgery. It's a simple procedure and it will relieve your pain.

Simon: So, it's not a high risk operation?

Dr. Slope: No, not at all. It's quite routine.

Simon: Are there any other treatment options?

Dr. Slope: Not that I'd recommend. This is the best course of treatment, in my opinion.

I was really surprised by what Dr. Slope said. I really didn't want to have surgery. I think I'd better get a second opinion before going under the knife.

### 0165 A Practical Joke

Joey: I've had it. I'm not going to take it anymore.

Rachel: What's the matter?

Joey: I'm sick and tired of being the butt of Chandler's practical jokes. One of these days, he's really going to get someone hurt.

Rachel: Oh no! What has he done now?

Joey: I went back to my office after lunch and sat down at my desk. After about a half hour, I got up to get some coffee. I walked out of my office and I hear

Phoebe giggling behind me.

Rachel: What was so funny?

Joey: Chandler had put a sticker on my chair that stuck to my pants when I got up.

Rachel: What did it say?

Joey: It said, “I'm a Red Hot Mama.”

Rachel: That's terrible. I can see why you're mad. You may be a “Red Hot Papa,” but definitely not a “Red Hot Mama.”

Joey: Very funny. One of these days, he's going to get it. I'm planning my revenge.

### 0166 A Marriage Proposal I

I've been trying to get up the nerve to ask my girlfriend to marry me. We have been dating for almost a year, and I think she's the one. I went shopping for engagement rings and really hated the experience. I wasn't sure what kind of ring she'd like and it took me a long time to decide. Finally, with the help of the saleswoman, I picked one.

So, I've got the ring, now I've just got to find the right time to pop the question. I needed to think for a romantic way to propose. I've watched enough romantic movies with my girlfriend to know that the proposal has to be something special. I thought about taking her on a trip to Paris and asking her in the “city of love,” but I spent all of my money on the ring, so that's out of the question. I thought about writing her a love poem and proposing in the poem, but I'm a terrible writer. I thought about serenading her outside the window, but with my voice, I'm sure the neighbors would call the police.

I don't know what to do. How do I ask her to marry me?

### 0167 Marriage Proposal Part II

I had been stressing out about it for a couple of weeks. How do I ask my girlfriend to marry me? We were getting some dinner at a fast food restaurant before going to the movies.

Fiona: Tell me the truth. What's up with you lately?

Doug: Me? Nothing. Why do you ask?

Fiona: You haven't been yourself. You've been quiet and distant. Are you seeing someone else?

Doug: No, of course I'm not! I would never cheat on you.

Fiona: Then, do you want to break up with me?

Doug: No way! That's the last thing I want to do. You've got it all wrong.

Fiona: Then tell me what's on your mind.

Doug: I...well...it's just that...oh, I can't stand it anymore. I've been carrying around this ring in my pocket for two weeks, trying to get up the nerve to ask you. Fiona, will you marry me?

Fiona: Ah, I can't believe it! Are you serious?

Doug: I've never been more serious. This wasn't the way I wanted to ask you, but will you?

Fiona: Yes, I'll marry you! And I thought you wanted to break up.

Doug: No, I don't, silly! I want us to be together for the rest of our lives. Don't you know that?

### 0168 The Home Improvement Store

When you own a house, there is always something that needs work. I've been putting off repainting the garage and I decided that I would do it this weekend.

I went to the home improvement store early in the morning to get the supplies I'd need. I walked into the huge store and began looking for the paint department. I walked through the garden center and the lumber department, but couldn't find the paint supplies. I tried to find a store employee to ask about it, but there was no one in sight. I walked down the plumbing aisles and finally found the paint department.

I looked at the paint swatches and found the color I wanted. I took a number to have my paint mixed. When my number was called, I gave the employee the swatch of the color I wanted and he told me he would call me again when it was ready. In the meantime, I got some brushes and rags. After about twenty minutes, the employee called my number and I picked up my paint. I took the paint and the other supplies and got into a checkout line.

After all that, I was exhausted. And I hadn't even started painting yet! Maybe I'll do that next weekend.

### 0169 Describing People’s Looks

Gilles: Hey, what are you looking at?

Nora: Oh these? They’re pictures from my trip back home last month.

Gilles: Let's have a look. So, who's this?

Nora: That's my sister and that's my cousin Keira.

Gilles: Your sister looks nothing like you. You're fair and she has dark hair and dark eyes. Now, you look much more like your cousin.

Nora: Yeah, that's true. Keira and I both have heart-shaped faces, thin lips, fat cheeks, and bushy eyebrows. Gorgeous!

Gilles: You don't give yourself enough credit. Why do you think every one of your guy friends is interested in you? Hey, who's the little girl?

Nora: Oh, that's my cousin Adriano's daughter. She's seven. She's very pretty, as you can see, and has the most beautiful wavy hair. That's her baby brother who was just born in April.

Gilles: Oh, man! He's so cute. That pudgy face, curly hair, and big eyes. He's adorable!

Nora: Yeah, I think he looks just like me.

Gilles: Hmm...I think I better stop complimenting you. It's going straight to your head.

### 0170 Questions and Answers at a Presentation

Our company hired an outside firm to set up a computer system, to help us keep track of the progress on major projects. The company gave us a presentation on how the new system worked. Afterwards, the employees got a chance to ask questions.

Cecilia: So, in a nutshell, those are the features of the new system. Any questions?

Yuri: Yes, I have a question. From your description, it sounds like the new system may be difficult to use. Can you speak to that?

Cecilia: I understand your concern, but actually, the system is very simple to use. I mentioned a lot of features that the system has, but the typical employee won't be using more than two or three on a daily basis. Yes, you have a question?

Alessandro: Yeah, my biggest concern is that all of the employees in the company will have access to the system. How does this affect my projects that have sensitive information?

Cecilia: That's a good question. One of the key features of the program is that it allows the project manager to limit access for any of his or her projects. Now, if there are no other questions, thank you all for coming and we look forward to working with you in the future.

### 0171 Buying a Used Car

(phone rings...)

Samantha: Hello.

Terry: Hey, Samantha. It's Terry.

Samantha: Oh, hi Terry. How's it going?

Terry: Not bad. Hey, the reason I'm calling is that I heard from Veronica that you're looking for a used car.

Samantha: Yeah, I'm hoping to find something reliable but cheap.

Terry: Well, I have just the thing for you. My brother has a 2001 Ford he's trying to sell. It has low miles, it's in good condition, and he's in a hurry to sell it.

Samantha: Your brother, huh? That's not the same brother who tried to sell me a stereo system that fell off the back of a truck, is it?

Terry: No, no, no. That's a different brother. Listen, this is a really nice car. It has a leather interior, power windows and doors, gets great gas mileage, and the tires are practically new. And, it's a steal at $7,000.

Samantha: How do I know it's not a lemon? I don't want to end up with a piece of junk.

Terry: Come on. Would I steer you wrong?

Samantha: Well, it won't hurt to go see it and to give it a test drive.

Terry: Trust me. You won't be sorry.

Samantha: We'll see about that.

### 0172 Legal Problems

I was reading the newspaper this morning and saw a story about a university student arrested and charged with burglary and assault. Last Monday, this student hit a security guard over the head, broke into his professor's office and stole the professor's computer. He wasn't doing well in the class and thought that he could steal the exam.

When he was arraigned in court, the prosecutor said that the charges were very serious felonies, and not simple misdemeanors. He also said that because the student was a flight risk, the bail should be set at $2 million dollars. The judge agreed. If the student is found guilty of all the charges, he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in jail.

When I read this story, I thought, wouldn't it have been easier for him to just study?

### 0173 Buying Souvenirs

I was vacationing in Miami, Florida, and I went to a souvenir store to get some gifts for friends back home.

Lydia: Could you show me where the T-shirts are?

Clerk: Sure, they're on the left, along the wall. Can I help you find something?

Lydia: I'd like to get a T-shirt, but I'm not sure about the size. It's for a friend who's about your size.

Clerk: Well, in that case, you'll need a large. I only have these in medium or small, but I have these two in size large.

Lydia: Do you have anything in another color or another style?

Clerk: How about this one?

Lydia: That's great. Could you also recommend a gift for a young woman?

Clerk: We have a lot of locally-made items. I don't think you want a mug, a key chain, or a snow globe. But, how about some jewelry?

Lydia: Oh, this bracelet is nice! How much is it?

Clerk: It's on sale for $36.00.

Lydia: Okay, I'll take the T-shirt and the necklace. Do you have a box for the necklace?

Clerk: Sure, no problem. That will be $59.60 with tax.

Lydia: There you go.

Clerk: Here's your change. Thanks for coming in.

### 0174 A Potluck

Mike: Thanks a lot for agreeing to help me plan the block party.

Susan: Oh, I'm happy to help. I'm surprised you didn't ask Bree. She's so good at planning parties.

Mike: I thought about it, but I was afraid she would turn it into a cocktail party or something.

Susan: Yeah, I see what you mean. Well, I made a guest list to see how many people may be attending. We can put the invitations in their mailboxes this weekend. It will be a potluck, so I'm asking people to RSVP and to let me know what they plan to bring.

Mike: What kind of things do we need?

Susan: Well, I'm asking people to bring a main dish, chips and dip, or dessert. It won't be a BYOB like last year, so Lynette and Edie are bringing some soda. I can supply the paper plates and cups, and the plastic utensils.

Mike: That's great. It sounds like you have everything under control.

Susan: I really can't believe it. There's a first time for everything.

### 0175 Places to Live

Finding a new place to live isn't always easy. I've been living in the same apartment for nine years, and I thought it was time for a change. I’ve always wanted to buy a condo or a townhouse, but I didn't have the money for a down payment. But now, I have a little money saved up, and I want to buy a place of my own.

I didn't want to go through a real estate agent yet, so I started looking around the city on my own. I wasn't sure if I wanted a townhouse or a single-family home. I didn't want to live in a multi-story building anymore, not even if I had a penthouse unit. It was too noisy, and I wanted a backyard for my dog, Shiloh.

I looked at a duplex as well as some traditional houses. One of the last houses I saw was a two-bedroom, one-bath bungalow. It was small enough for one person, but big enough for me and my dog. When Shiloh saw the backyard, I think it was love at first sight. I’d like to say that I picked the house, but really it was Shiloh’s choice. I don't think he would ever forgive me if I didn't buy that house.

### 0176 Time Off from Work

My buddy from college, Jack, was getting married and our friend Rob was planning a bachelor party for him in Vegas. It was going to be the last weekend of the month and I wanted to go. The trouble was, I was scheduled to work that weekend. I needed to get the time off from work or I was going to miss out on all the fun.

I have some vacation leave, but company policy requires that my boss sign off on any leave we take. I've heard of companies doing that for longer periods of leave - like maternity leave or a leave of absence - but our company does that even for vacation leave. I thought about just calling in sick that weekend - I do have a lot of accumulated sick leave - but I didn't think my boss would appreciate me leaving him hanging.

In the end I just asked him straight out and to my surprise he said, "okay." Now, I just need to get ready for a wild weekend with the guys. I can't wait.

### 0177 A Wild Driver

Yasmine and I were going to a show at the Staples Center and Yasmine was driving. My friends warned me about her driving, but they didn't prepare me for this ride.

Pedro: Whoa, slow down! You almost rear?ended that SUV.

Yasmine: No, I didn't. Take it easy. I have everything under control. I'm not even speeding, that much. You're the one who doesn't want to be late for the show.

Pedro: Yeah, but I want to get there in one piece. Hey, what are you doing? You're not going to make an illegal U?turn across four lanes of traffic, are you?

Yasmine: I have to.

Pedro: Why?

Yasmine: I was going the wrong way on a one-way street.

Pedro: Oh, geez. I think you just took ten years off my life.

Yasmine: Don't be such a wuss. Buckle up and enjoy the ride. We're just getting started.

### 0178 A Fight

Ginger: I can't believe it. You're late again!

Fred: I got caught up at work. What are you so worked up about?

Ginger: I've had it up to here with your excuses. If you knew you were going to be late, why didn't you call? We've been over this a hundred times.

Fred: There wasn't time to call. And plus, what's the big deal? I'm just a little late.

Ginger: A little late? You are an hour late. You are so inconsiderate sometimes…[sigh]…You look tired.

Fred: Yeah, I am. Look, I'm late and I was inconsiderate. Let's not let it ruin our evening.

Ginger: Okay, I'm sorry. Maybe I overreacted. I know you've been really busy at work.

Fred: I'm the one who’s sorry. I should have called. Will you let me make it up to you?

Ginger: You don't have to. I shouldn't nag.

Fred: You weren't nagging. Let's go get something to eat. We'll both feel better with some food in our stomachs.

Ginger: Yeah, you're right. Let's go.

### 0179 Shopping for a Cell Phone

Greg: I needed a new cell phone, and my friend recommended the company he used. I went into the store to take a look.

Woman: Hi, have you been helped?

Greg: No, I haven't. I'm looking for a new phone.

Woman: Are you with our company right now?

Greg: No, I'm thinking about switching.

Woman: Okay, let me show you our most popular phone. This one has a lot of good features. It's got a camera phone, a video recorder, instant messaging, and you can download music or ring tones.

Greg: I'm really looking for a flip phone.

Woman: Oh, in that case, this is the one you want. Let me tell you a little about our plans. With our $59.99 plan, you get 400 minutes, unlimited night and weekend minutes, and free mobile-to-mobile.

Greg: Do the minutes roll over if I don't use them all in one month, and do I need to sign an agreement?

Woman: We don't have rollover minutes, but if you think 400 isn't enough, we have higher plans for 700, 1000, and unlimited minutes. The $59.99 plan requires a one-year agreement.

Greg: Okay, let me think about it.

Woman: No problem. Just let me know if you have other questions.

### 0180 Airport Layover

I was going to see a friend of mine in Oklahoma City and decided to use my frequent flyer miles. I booked a flight, but the only one they had had a long layover in Denver. I had three hours to kill and I decided to get something to eat at the food court.

Unfortunately, I didn't check my bags and had my roller bag and carry-on with me. I lugged them with me, but when I got to the food court, all of the tables were taken.

Man: Do you want to share my table?

Anne: Oh, uh, thanks, that would be great. It's packed in here.

Man: Yeah, it's always like this on Friday afternoons.

Anne: You must travel a lot.

Man: Yeah, it's part of my job. It looks like you've got a lot of stuff with you. Do you want me to keep an eye on it while you get your food?

Anne: Thanks, but I think I'll take it with me. But, if you could save this seat for me, that would be great.

Man: Sure, you got it.

### 0181 Company Profiles

Roberta: What are you working on?

Lee: Oh, I'm writing the company profiles for the businesses participating in the meeting next month. Do you have a minute to give me some feedback?

Roberta: Sure, what do you have so far?

Lee: I've started to write the ones for Landrun and Max Electronics. This is what I have for Lundrun so far: “A Fortune 500 company, Lundrun is a world leader in car manufacturing. Founded in 1936, Lundrun today is a $90 billion dollar company that sets a standard in the industry.”

Roberta: That's pretty good. Don't forget to mention that their headquarters are in Chicago.

Lee: Oh, yeah, I'll make sure I add that. Okay, here's what I have for Max Electronics: “Max Electronics is a Frankfurt-based company that has been a pioneer in the manufacturing of home electronics for over 75 years. The company has a global network of 1,500 distributors and has stores in 53 countries worldwide.”

Roberta: That's a good start. Why don't you pass them by me when you're done and I can give you some more feedback?

Lee: Yeah, I'll do that. Thanks a lot.

### 0182 A Star Trek Convention

Guido: Whoa. Check you out. That's a great costume. Are you going to the Star Trek convention?

Rita: Yeah. It's in town until Sunday. Have you ever been to one?

Guido: Me? No way. Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of the shows and, no offense, but I thought only geeks went to the conventions.

Rita: Yeah, I thought that too until I went last year with my friend Claire and we had a great time.

Guido: Claire? Your gorgeous roommate, Claire? That Claire?

Rita: Yeah. There were exhibitions from collectors and we got autographs from two of the show's stars. The highlight was when the stars came out and spoke to the crowd. Hey, do you want to come with us?

Guido: It actually sounds like fun but I can't make it today.

Rita: How come?

Guido: Um…well…I'm going to the comic book convention.

Rita: Oh, I see. Well, maybe next year. Live long and prosper.

Guido: Uh, yeah. You, too. Hey, tell Claire I said “hi.”

Rita: Sure. See you later.

### 0183 At the Pharmacy

I went to the drugstore down the street to fill a prescription at the pharmacy. I’ve had some problems with my arm, and the doctor prescribed for me a new medication. I waited in line, and when it was my turn, I handed the prescription to the pharmacist. She told me to come back in fifteen minutes and she would have it ready for me.

In the meantime, I went to look for some over-the-counter stomach medication. There were some in tablets and capsules. I decided on the capsules and returned to the pharmacy.

The pharmacist asked me if I had taken this medication before. I told her I hadn’t and she pointed out the directions on the bottle. It had the dosage information: Take two tablets two times a day. There was also a warning to not take it on an empty stomach. The bottle also said that I should stop taking the medication if I had any serious side effects. The pharmacist told me to follow the directions closely so that I can avoid an overdose. I paid for the medication and thanked her for her help.

### 0184 Running a Meeting

Good morning, everyone. I believe we are all here. Please be seated and let’s get started.

Please join me in welcoming Olivia Dansk, from Garland Corporation. I’m afraid that Lionel Wu from Manatect can’t be with us today, but I’m pleased to welcome representatives from both Danforth and Boyent.

We’re here today to discuss the progress of our joint venture project. Have you all received a copy of the agenda? Good. As you can see, there are six items on the agenda. If there are no objections, I suggest we take the items in order. Let’s start with number 1.

……

I think that takes care of the first item.? Why don't we move on to item number two. I’d like to hand it over to Olivia, who will take us through the report. Olivia?

……

If there are no other issues to discuss, I’d like to wrap up this meeting. Our next meeting will be on Monday, November 20th. Before we end today, I’d like to thank all of you for coming. This has been a very productive meeting.

### 0185 Ways to Pay

I was at the store, and when the clerk finished ringing me up, I had a few problems.

Clerk: Your total comes to $79.42.

Peter: Do you take credit cards?

Clerk: Yes, we take Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.

Peter: Here’s my Visa.

Clerk: Hmm…I’m sorry but your card has been declined.

Peter: Oh, I can’t imagine why. I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Here, use my MasterCard.

Clerk: Well, sir, it looks like this one is overdrawn, too. Do you have a debit card or cash? We also accept personal checks.

Peter: Like I said, I think it must be bank error. Yeah, I have a debit card, but I think there’s a fee for using it, right?

Clerk: Yes, I think the bank charges you a small fee.

Peter: In that case, I’ll write a check. Oh no, I forgot my checkbook at home. Can you hold these items for me? I can run to an ATM to get some cash. I’ll come right back.

Clerk: Sure. I can hold it for you until the end of the day.

Peter: Okay, great. I’ll be right back.

### 0186 Dating a Younger Man/Woman

Tadashi: Was that Diane you were talking to just now?

Helen: Yeah, do you know her?

Tadashi: Diane and I used to work together. She looked happy.

Helen: Yeah, she’s dating a new man. I just got the scoop. He’s not her usual type.

Tadashi: What do you mean?

Helen: Well, he’s a little younger than she is.

Tadashi: That’s no big deal nowadays. How much younger?

Helen: Diane is 42 and he’s 27.

Tadashi: They’re 15 years apart! Talk about robbing the cradle!

Helen: Hey, didn’t you just say that May-December romances aren’t that uncommon? From what Diane tells me, they have a lot of things in common.

Tadashi: Yes, I did. But, that was before I knew there was such a huge age difference between them. I know that my parents wouldn’t approve of me dating a woman 15 years older than me.

Helen: Aren’t you being a hypocrite? After your parents divorced, didn’t your father remarry? And, isn’t your step-mother 18 years younger than your father?

Tadashi: But, but…that’s different.

Helen: How? Because Diane is a woman and your father is a man?

Tadashi: Yeah. I don’t mind saying it. There’s a double standard. I think a lot of people would agree with me.

Helen: You may be right, but I’m not one of them.

### 0187 Enjoying the Outdoors

My favorite time of year is the summer. I like being outdoors, doing anything from hiking to going to the beach. One thing about working in an office all week is that I don’t get much fresh air. With summer here, I plan to take full advantage.

Last week, I went to the beach with some friends. I was glad I brought sunscreen since it was a really hot day, and I’m sure I would have gotten a sunburn within 15 minutes! We set up our beach umbrella and beach chairs, and played some volleyball. A few of us went into the ocean for a swim, but most of my friends just lounged around on the sand.

This weekend, I’m going hiking. I stopped by the store and got some insect repellent. The last time I hiked in the mountains, I came back with big mosquito bites all over my legs. This time, I’m going to be prepared. I was going to try a new trail and I wasn’t going to let a few mosquitoes get in the way.

### 0188 Correcting Misunderstandings at Work

I work in our company’s Toledo office and I was meeting with my counterpart in our Raleigh office. I was trying to explain to her our new proposal to make some changes in the corporate structure. But, it wasn’t going very well.

Rory: So, with the new plan, the managers would report directly to the CEO?

Dean: That’s not quite right. The local managers would report to the regional managers, and the regional managers would be supervised by the COO. That would give the COO more oversight than he has now.

Rory: You’re saying, then, that the managers aren’t being well supervised now?

Dean: No, that’s not what I meant. We were actually thinking that the new plan would free up the CEO to work on attracting new business.

Rory: So, you think that the problem is with the CEO. He’s not doing his job.

Dean: No, that’s not it at all. What I’m trying to say is that we need this new plan because our office has expanded so much in the past year.

Rory: Well, I don’t really agree with you. I think that both the CEO and COO are doing a fine job now.

Dean: I think we may have our wires crossed. Let’s set up a meeting for next week to talk more about it.

Rory: Okay. That’s fine with me.

### 0189 Getting Home Late from School

Dad: Where have you been? Do you know what time it is?

Caitlin: I’m sorry, Dad. I lost track of time.

Dad: Lost track of time? We’ve been worried sick about you. You were supposed to come straight home after school.

Caitlin: I know, but Janet was showing me something in her locker when a fight broke out in the hallway. The vice principal, Mr. Lopez, finally came out and broke it up.

Dad: That still doesn’t explain why you’re late. And, I don’t want any excuses.

Caitlin: Well, one of the guys in the fight was Dan, Janet’s brother. Mr. Lopez called their parents and I waited with her until they got there.

Dad: I never liked Dan. He’s trouble. I don’t want you hanging around with him.

Caitlin: I don’t. I’m friends with Janet, not her brother. I didn’t do anything wrong.

Dad: Oh, really? You missed curfew last week and now you’re late again. Just wait until your mother hears about this. You’re grounded for a week.

Caitlin: Dad! That’s not fair! None of my friend’s parents are as strict as you are.

Dad: That’s enough. I won’t have you talking back to me. Now, go to your room.

### 0190 Taking a Phone Message

I was looking forward to a quiet evening at home. As soon as I walked in the door, though, the phone rang.

Paolo: Hello.

Evelyn: Hi, could I speak to Tony?

Paolo: He’s not here right now. Can I take a message?

Evelyn: Do you know when he’ll be back?

Paolo: No, I don’t.

Evelyn: Okay. I’ll call back later. Thanks.

…..

Ten minutes later, the phone rang again.

Paolo: Hello.

Pam: Hi, is Tony there?

Paolo: No, he’s out.

Pam: Could I leave a message?

Paolo: Sure. Give me a second to get something to write with. Okay, I’m ready.

Pam: Could you tell him that Pam called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can.

Paolo: Does he have your number?

Pam: He should, but I’d better give it to you. It’s 279-555-6347.

Paolo: Okay, I’ll tell him.

Pam: Thanks.

…..

As soon as I put down the receiver, the phone rang again. I couldn’t believe it.

Paolo: Hello.

Susan: Hi, is this Tony?

Paolo: No, I’m his roommate, Paolo. Tony’s not here right now.

Susan: I need to get a hold of him. Do you have his cell number?

Paolo: Uh, yeah, I do, but I’m not sure he wants me to give it out.

Susan: Oh, I’m sure he’d want me to have it.

Paolo: I'll tell you what. Why don’t I take your number and have him call you back?

Susan: I really need to get a hold of him right away.

Paolo: I’ll give him your message as soon as he gets home.

Susan: Fine. This is Susan and my number is 742-555-3655. Please make sure he gets it. It’s important. Bye.

Paolo: Bye.

As soon as she hung up, I took the phone off the hook for the rest of the night. I’d had enough of being Tony’s answering service for one night!

### 0191 Changing Money

I was at the airport to pick up my friend Sandra, who was visiting from Italy.

Gustavo: Do you have everything?

Sandra: Yes, I think so. But, I don’t have any U.S. dollars. Where can I change money? Can I do that here?

Gustavo: You could, but I wouldn’t recommend it. The exchange rate is really high and so are the fees. I’ll take you to the bank tomorrow.

The next day, I picked Sandra up from her hotel and we went to a branch nearby.

Bank clerk: What can I do for you?

Sandra: I’d like to exchange some currency and to get some U.S. dollars.

Bank clerk: Okay, how much would you like?

Sandra: How much is one euro worth?

Bank clerk: The current rate is one dollar to .8 euros.

Sandra: In that case, I’d like 500 U.S. dollars.

Bank clerk: Okay. That will be 400 euros. Would you like that in large or small bills?

Sandra: I’d like a mix of both. I’d like some change, too.

Bank clerk: That’s no problem. Please sign here. That will be 300 dollars in 20’s, 150 dollars in 10’s, and 45 dollars in fives and ones. And, here’s five dollars in change: quarters, dimes, and nickels.

Sandra: That’s perfect. Thanks a lot.

Bank clerk: Is there anything else I can help you with?

Sandra: No, that’s all. Thanks for your help.

Bank clerk: It’s my pleasure. Have a nice day.

### 0192 Winning the Lottery

Daniela: I got our lottery tickets during my lunch break. The jackpot is up to $168 million dollars. Imagine if we won.

Boris: Thanks for getting mine, too. When is the drawing?

Daniela: Saturday at 6 PM. It’s being televised on Channel 4.

Boris: What would you do if you had $168 million dollars?

Daniela: The first thing I would do is quit my job! No more slaving away for me. What would you do?

Boris: If I were rich, I would travel around the world. If I were younger, I’d learn how to fly a plane. I’ve always wanted to do that.

Daniela: It’s never too late. You could still do that.

Boris: You can’t teach an old dog new tricks. I’d probably just retire and buy myself a nice new house.

Daniela: Yeah, that sounds nice. I suppose I’d have a lot of family and friends asking for money.

Boris: I know I would. I can just see them coming out of the woodwork and pestering me. Maybe winning the lottery isn’t such a good thing.

Daniela: You’re right. It’s a curse. When you win, you can give me all of the money.

Boris: Yeah, right. Don’t hold your breath!

### 0193 Placing a Business Order

Jessie: Good morning. This is Jessie Lipman calling from Wexman. I wanted to place an order.

Rudy: Certainly. Are you ordering from our catalog?

Jessie: Yes, I have the item numbers. But, before I place the new order, I wanted to check on some items we have on backorder.

Rudy: Sure, let me pull up your account. It looks like you have two items that are still outstanding, but we should have that to you by the end of the week.

Jessie: Can you give me a delivery date?

Rudy: It should arrive no later than the 19th.

Jessie: Okay. Let me give you the new order. The first item is 2456. We’d like 52 boxes. Last time, we were able to buy in bulk and got the wholesale price. I’m hoping we can negotiate that again for this order.

Rudy: That’s not a problem. What are the other items?

Jessie: The second item is 6849. We’d like 40 of them.

Rudy: There’s a price reduction of ten percent on that item. That brings the net price to 19 dollars. Anything else?

Jessie: That’s it for now. There are a few other things we need to order, but I still need to submit a requisition for a purchase order. Can you fax over an invoice for the items I just ordered?

Rudy: Sure, I’ll get that to you by the end of the day. We appreciate your order.

Jessie: No problem. Thanks.

### 0194 An Unwanted House Guest

About a month ago, my friend Richard called me and asked if he could come stay with me for a couple of weeks. I usually don't like having houseguests but Richard was a good friend. He's an artist and he was thinking about moving to LA. He wanted to see if he could get a job in the area. I told him, yes, of course, and he came down right away. As I said, that was a month ago. He's been living in my guestroom ever since.

I like Richard and we get along, but I just don't like having a roommate. Sometimes he gets in the way when I want to invite someone over and he's always hogging the couch. One of my pet peeves is a dirty bathroom and Richard is a slob. I finally decided to let him know that he had overstayed his welcome. But, how do you throw out one of your best friends?

On the day I was going to talk to Richard, he came home with some big news. He had met some guy at the employment agency and he planned to move in with him. I was bowled over! He had just met him. I tried to talk him out of it, but he'd made up his mind. Richard has always been a free spirit so who am I to tell him what to do? I just hope he'll be happy.

### 0195 At an Amusement Park

My brother, his wife, and their two daughters are in town and I had promised the girls that I would take them to an amusement park. I don’t really like roller coasters, but I knew the kids would like it.

On Saturday morning, we drove down to the theme park. We parked and took a shuttle to the park entrance. We looked at the ticket prices and decided to buy a day pass for each of us. Maria, the younger of the two kids, is only 2-years-old, and children under three get in free.

The first thing we did was stand in line for the biggest attraction in the park: a really big roller coaster. Actually, only Grace and I stood in line since Maria was too young to ride it. My brother and my sister-in-law took Maria to ride the Ferris wheel and carousel, and afterwards, we planned to meet near the concession stands so we could watch the parade at 2 o’clock. Grace and I finally made it to the head of the line and we got on the ride. I really don’t like roller coasters. When we got off, I felt queasy and had to sit down for a few minutes before I could walk again.

All in all, we had a good day at the amusement park. But, it will be long time before I go on a roller coaster again!

### 0196 A Business Plan

About a year ago, I came up with an idea that I thought would revolutionize the way people sell their goods on the Internet. After a lot of planning, I decided to try to attract investors by developing a business plan. I got some advice from my friend Steve who is a very successful entrepreneur.

First, he told me I needed to figure out my business model. How would my investors make money? How long would it take for the company to be in the black? Steve said that the proposal would need to show revenue projections for the first five years, and that I should give an estimate of gross sales for that same period.

Steve also said that I should include what I thought was the target market for the new service and my plan for convincing potential buyers that the new service would give them a competitive advantage.

After working on the plan for a few months, I thought it was ready to show to some prospective investors. All I need is just one big investor to take a chance on it. Hopefully, this time next year, I’ll be well on my way to building a new business empire.

### 0197 An Apology

Becky: Curt.

Curt: Oh, hi.

Becky: Can I talk to you for a minute?

Curt: I’m really busy right now.

Becky: Just one minute. I promise it won’t take long.

Curt: Okay. Let’s talk over here.

Becky: Curt, I’m really sorry that I told Joyce that you had a crush on her. We were just talking last Friday and it just slipped out.

Curt: But, I told you about Joyce in confidence.

Becky: I know. It’s totally my fault. I really regret saying anything. I wish I could take it back. I just want you to know that I’m really sorry and I hope that you’ll accept my apology.

Curt: What’s done is done. I was really pissed off when I found out this morning but I’m over it now. [cell phone ring] Hold on a sec. [long pause, muttering in background] Guess who that was?

Becky: Who?

Curt: Joyce. She wanted to know if I’d like to have lunch with her today.

Becky: It was? That’s great, maybe…

Curt: And, maybe not. Maybe she just wants to tell me she’s not interested in me.

Becky: Or, maybe she likes you, too.

Curt: Don’t let your imagination run away with you.

Becky: I won’t but I’m keeping my fingers crossed.

### 0198 Starting a Band

At work one afternoon, my friend Michael asked me if I wanted to help him start a band. I was really surprised because I didn’t even know Michael was a musician. As it turns out, not only was Michael a good guitarist, he was also a good songwriter. He wanted to get together a band and maybe start playing some gigs.

I was interested, but I wasn’t sure if my voice was good enough to be the lead singer. After hearing me sing, Michael said that he thought I was. With me in the band, we still needed a drummer and a bass player. My sister wanted to be a back-up singer for the band, but we didn’t think we needed one yet.

We auditioned a lot of people and found our other two band members. They had their own instruments and even had the sound equipment we’d need. We start rehearsal next week. Hopefully, we’ll be able to get a demo made soon and get hired as an opening act for another band. And, who knows? You may be seeing us as headliners in your city before too long.

### 0199 A Love Letter

Vicky: What are you working on?

Issac: If I tell you, will you promise not to laugh?

Vicky: All right. What is it?

Issac: It’s a love letter to Julie.

Vicky: Isn’t it a little premature? You’ve only been going out for a month.

Issac: Maybe, but I really want her to know how I feel.

Vicky: Let me see it. “Dear Julie. I’m writing this letter to pour my heart out to you. When we met, it was love at first sight and I can’t get you out of my head. You mean everything to me. Now that we’re together, how can I ever live without you?”

Issac: So, what do you think?

Vicky: I thought it would have some simple sweet nothings. I didn’t expect it to be this heavy.

Issac: Do you think it needs more terms of endearment? Maybe I should have called her “my love,” “my darling,” or “sweetheart.” Tell me the truth, do you think it’s too much? I don’t want to scare her off.

Vicky: Well, I know you’re head over heels in love with her, but if I were you, I’d play it by ear. Give it to her when you feel the time is right.

Issac: Okay, thanks. I’ll try to play it cool, for now.

### 0200 Meeting a Deadline

Pam: You wanted to see me?

Ed: Yes, I did. Have a seat. I want to talk to you about the Pulsen project.

Pam: I know I’m a little late in getting that report to you, but I’ve been pulling out the stops to get it done.

Ed: But it’s still not done, is it? You know that the deadline for the next milestone of the project was this past Monday.

Pam: Yes, I know, but the scope of the project turned out to be a lot bigger than I had anticipated. And, they just didn’t allocate enough resources for something this size. Is there any way we can push back the deadline by a week?

Ed: The time to ask that was last week, not after you’ve missed the deadline. I have the management breathing down my neck about this report. I’ve tried to stall them for the past two days and they’re not happy.

Pam: I promise to have it on your desk by tomorrow morning. You have my word.

Ed: All right. I’ll give you until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. I’m tired of taking the heat, though, and I don’t plan to do it any longer.

Pam: You can count on me.

Ed: Don’t let me down.

Pam: I won’t.

### 0201 Making a Bet

Suzanna: Hey, the back of the line is over there.

Ivan: I was here. I just stepped out of line for a minute to get some cash.

Suzanna: Yeah, right. I don’t remember you being in line ahead of me.

Ivan: Come on. Let’s do this. We’ll flip for it. If it’s heads, I win and I get to get back into line. If it’s tails, you win and I’ll go to the back of the line.

Suzanna: All right. I’ll take those odds. You’re on.

Ivan: Here goes…Oh, it’s heads! I win.

Suzanna: I guess it’s your lucky day.

Ivan: I guess so. How about going double or nothing?

Suzanna: What are the stakes?

Ivan: If it’s tails and you win, I go to the back of the line and I have to buy you a drink when we get inside. If it’s heads and I win, I get back in line in front of you and you buy me a drink.

Suzanna: So, no matter what happens I have to have a drink with you?

Ivan: That’s the idea. What do you say?

Suzanna: Okay, you talked me into it. Let’s see if your luck will hold up.

Ivan: I’ve got a good feeling it will.

### 0202 At the Gas Station

It’s been a long time since I’ve seen my friends Steve and Liz, and I thought this would be a good weekend to drive up to Santa Barbara to see them. Gas prices have been through the roof, but I decided to take the short road trip anyway. Before getting on the road, I went to the gas station to fill up my tank.

I drove past the full-service pump and parked at the first self-service one. I got out of the car and saw that there was an “out of order” sign telling customers to pay inside. I wanted to pay at the pump so I got back into the car and pulled up to the next one. Luckily for me, this one was working.

I swiped my credit card and took the gas cap off. I pushed the button for the grade of unleaded gas I wanted and put the nozzle into my tank. There was a sign on the pump that read, “Do not top off.” After the tank was full, I replaced the nozzle and pressed the button for a receipt. Right when I was about to leave, I noticed that my windows were dirty, so I got the squeegee and some paper towels and cleaned them. Now, I was ready for my drive up north.

### 0203 Text Messaging

I was supposed to meet Jenny at the library, but I was late. Jenny texted me: “I M @ lib wher r u?”

I’m not very good at texting so I used a template to say I was going to be late. When I arrived at the library, Jenny laughed at me because she knew I didn’t know how to text.

Richard: I don’t know how to use this thing. The phone kept making up words for me.

Jenny: That's because you were composing in predictive text mode. You have to change your settings to normal tap mode so only the characters you want show up in the screen.

Richard: Okay, but everything still shows up in capital letters.

Jenny: You can change the option by pressing the button. See? The screen will show you what kind of letters or numbers you can get, and you keep pushing the button until the one you want comes up.

Richard: What about the symbol you used in your message?

Jenny: You press the 1 button or the 0 button for those. I use them as abbreviations to save time when I am texting. I always use the symbols “@” and “&” for “at” and “and.” Simple words like “you,” “are,” and “be” can be spelled with the letters “u,” “r,” and “b.” It saves time.

Richard: Thanks. I think I’ve got it, but it’ll take some practice for me to get up to speed.

Jenny: No problem. Each time I get a strange message that doesn’t make any sense, I’ll know it’s from you.

### 0204 Using Visuals in a Presentation

Rosa: Thanks a lot for offering to give me some pointers on how to use visuals for my presentation. I’ve never given a presentation like this before.

Milo: I’m glad I can help. What do you plan to use?

Rosa: Well, I plan to show these slides for the first part of the talk. First, I have this pie chart that shows the types of services our company provides. Then, I have this bar graph to show how the company has grown in the past 20 years. But, I’m not really sure how to talk about them.

Milo: Okay, first, when you’re using a chart, make sure you explain what each part represents. For example, on this pie chart, I would explain that each slice of the pie represents a percentage of the business. Then, for this bar chart, I’d make sure to tell the audience what the X-axis and Y-axis stand for, and what each increment represents. That way, the trend that the company is following is clear. Are you planning on using this line chart, too?

Rosa: No, I changed my mind about that. I think it’s a little confusing, but your tips on the other charts are really helpful. I have this flip chart, too, that I’m supposed to use but I’m not sure how. I don’t want turn my back on the audience during the presentation.

Milo: The second half of the presentation includes some audience participation, right? Then, I think it’s fine to use it during that part of the talk. Any other questions?

Rosa: I don’t think so. You’ve been so helpful. I hope you’ll let me take you to lunch as a token of thanks.

Milo: You don’t need to treat, but I’d be happy to have lunch together. Let’s go.

### 0205 Shopping for Shoes

Clerk: Can I help you find something?

Alissa: Yes, I’m looking for some dress shoes for work, something with a low heel.

Clerk: Have you tried this brand? They make really comfortable shoes. This company makes several styles of dress shoes, including a sandal, a low boot, and a loafer. These right here are open toe and those over there have a strap in the back.

Alissa: Oh, I like these slip-ons, but they seem too narrow. My feet are pretty wide.

Clerk: Those actually come in three widths: narrow, medium, and wide. Do you want to try them on?

Alissa: Sure. Do you have them in a 6-and-a-half or a 7, in black or brown?

Clerk: I’m not sure. I’ll have to check in the back…Here you are. How does the 6-and-a-half fit?

Alissa: They’re a little too tight in the toe. Let me try the 7. Oh, that’s better, but now the heel is a little too loose.

Clerk: Keep in mind that since they’re leather, they’ll stretch a little.

Alissa: In that case, I’ll take the black pair in the 6-and-a-half.

Clerk: Great. I can ring you up over here.

### 0206 A Generation Gap

Carlos: Belinda, maybe you can explain it to me. My parents still don’t get me. I got a couple of tattoos and they freaked out.

Belinda: Why are you asking me? I may be a few years older than you are, but I don’t understand parents any better than you do. They’re hopelessly behind the times.

Carlos: I don’t really expect them to keep up with what’s going on right now or to know anything about what’s in and what’s out, but I thought they’d understand if I wanted to express myself. They were hippies in their day.

Belinda: Yeah, but being a hippie isn’t the same thing as being a hipster. Most of them just don’t keep up with pop culture. You know, now that I think about it, I’m not sure that’s such a bad thing.

Carlos: What do you mean?

Belinda: Can you imagine going to the same clubs as your parents, or you and your parents reading the same blogs?

Carlos: Oh, that would really suck. Okay, you’ve made your point. Things could be a lot worse.

### 0207 Giving Birth in a Hospital

It was 2 o’clock in the morning when my wife woke me up. She is eight-and-a-half months pregnant and she told me that her water had broken. She said that she was having contractions and she was sure that she was in labor. I paged our doctor and drove to the hospital.

When we arrived, we went straight to the maternity ward. I went to the reception desk, and told the clerk that my wife was in labor and needed to be admitted right away. The nurse asked me for my insurance card and gave me three forms to fill out. She said that someone would take my wife into the birthing suite soon.

The doctor arrived and she examined my wife. She told us that this wasn’t false labor and that my wife was pretty far along. After a lot of pushing, the baby came out head first, not breech, and it was healthy.

I was so relieved, I couldn’t stop hugging my wife. Then, I hugged the doctor, and the nurse, and the janitor!

### 0208 Corporate Image

Adam: With our expansion into these new areas of business, I think we need to think seriously about changing our corporate image. We’re much more than just a paper company now.

Eva: I think you’re right. Our brand has changed, and if we want to keep brand loyalty, we need to think about protecting and improving our product image.

Adam: I agree that that’s a key issue as we reposition ourselves in the industry. We can never lose sight of our end-users.

Eva: And, even though we have registered trademarks on some of the new prestige products, we need to have a plan if we want to turn these new products into household names.

Adam: I suggest we think about hiring a public relations firm. They may be able to help us update our corporate image and logo, and to shape our new corporate identity.

Eva: Why don’t I contact a few PR firms and set up some meetings?

Adam: Yes, do that. That seems like the logical next step.

### 0209 Extreme Sports

Celeste: I’m so glad it’s Friday. Are you doing anything this weekend?

Ryan: I’m going snowboarding with James.

Celeste: Didn’t you guys go bungee jumping last weekend?

Ryan: Yeah, and we plan to go cave diving in a couple of weeks.

Celeste: I didn’t know you were into extreme sports. I guess it’s a big adrenaline rush.

Ryan: It is. But for me, it’s about pushing myself to the limit.

Celeste: Aren’t you afraid of getting hurt?

Ryan: Sure. There’s always a danger of getting hurt, but we don’t do these sports competitively. It’s just for fun. I like trying new stunts and seeing how far we can push the boundaries of the sport. Do you want to come with us sometime?

Celeste: Me? I’m not really the adventurous type.

Ryan: You never know. You might like it. After cave diving, we’ll probably try climbing.

Celeste: Oh, that doesn’t sound too bad. I’ve done some climbing before.

Ryan: I should tell you that we plan on going ice climbing.

Celeste: Oh. In that case, I think I’ll pass. Have fun this weekend.

Ryan: Thanks and let me know if you change your mind.

### 0210 A Family Road Trip

Our family decided to take a road trip across the country this year. The kids were really excited and my oldest son wanted to help navigate. Before the trip, we looked at the road maps and decided on our route and the points of interest we would try to see. Since we wouldn’t be taking a camper, we needed to make hotel reservations along the way. After a little planning, we were ready to go.

The kids were behaving themselves the first day. My daughter was a little car sick in the morning, but we made it to our first stop without any major problems. On the second day, though, the kids were really acting up. They kept asking, “Are we there yet?” and they wanted to stop at every rest stop. My youngest son, who is only four, kept calling out the mile markers as we passed them, and I thought my head would explode if he didn’t stop. On top of that, my wife wanted to stop every few miles for a photo op and I thought we’d never get to the next town.

By the third day, I was really questioning the wisdom of taking three young children on the road for 10 days. I suspect that after this vacation, I’ll need another one to recover from it.

### 0211 Giving Bad News and Condolences

I was at the hospital at with my friend, Wendy. Her father was in an accident and she was waiting to talk to the doctor.

Doctor: Hello, I’m Dr. Johnson. How are you holding up?

Wendy: Oh, I’m fine. Is there any news?

Doctor: Yes. I have examined your father’s test results and I’m afraid the news isn’t good. His condition has deteriorated rapidly, and I want you to prepare for the worst.

Wendy: You’re not saying that he won’t recover, are you?

Doctor: We can hope for the best, but your father may only have a few days. I’m very sorry.

Wendy: Can I see my father?

Doctor: Yes, of course.

.......

The worst did happen and Wendy’s father passed away the following week. At both the wake and the funeral, we all tried to console Wendy by saying things like, “I’m sorry for your loss,” “Please accept my condolences,” and “My thoughts are with you during this difficult time.”

The funeral director made sure that the funeral service went smoothly. The eulogy was short and I went with Wendy to the burial. It was a difficult time for Wendy but hopefully, having her family and friends with her made it more bearable.

### 0212 Asking for a Raise

Patty: Alberto, can I pick your brain for a minute?

Alberto: Yeah, sure, but you’ll have to make it quick. I’m going into a meeting at 3.

Patty: Sure. Hopefully, this won’t take long. I’m thinking about asking for a raise. I’ve been working here for a year and half, and I now have a lot more responsibilities on my plate than when I started. I think I’ve earned a raise, but I don’t know how to broach the issue with Wayne. I can’t just go into his office and say, “Give me a raise!”

Alberto: You’re right. It’s not an easy thing to bring up. One thing I did when I asked for a raise last year was to remind Wayne of my qualifications and all of the work I do around here. I tried to convince Wayne that I was indispensable.

Patty: Obviously it worked. You got a raise and a promotion, too. All I want is a bump in pay.

Alberto: The trick is to sell yourself without seeming self-serving. And, you don’t want to give any ultimatums either. That definitely won’t fly with Wayne.

Patty: I can see that. I plan to talk to him at the end of the week so wish me luck.

Alberto: You don’t need it. I’m sure Wayne will see things your way.

### 0213 Buying a Bicycle

I went to the bike shop on Saturday morning to buy a bicycle.

Clerk: What kind of bike are you looking for?

Lance: I’m really not sure.

Clerk: Well, let me show you what we have. We carry road bikes, mountain bikes, beach cruisers, and racing bikes.

Lance: I’m going to start biking to work. I’ll be riding mainly on the road, but I want something versatile enough for anything.

Clerk: Well, the road bikes are for everyday use. They have heavy frames and tires. The seats are comfortable and so are the handlebars. The mountain bikes are very sturdy for off-road cycling and have wider tires. Beach cruisers have just one speed, so you won’t be shifting any gears.

Lance: Okay. Are the brakes hard to handle?

Clerk: No. You either have foot brakes, like on the beach cruisers, or you have hand brakes. They’re very easy to get used to. If you want to keep it simple, I would either go for a road bike or a mountain bike. Those are the most popular.

Lance: If I get a bike, what other things do I need?

Clerk: I usually recommend an air pump, a bike lock, and a helmet.

Lance: Okay, I’ll take a look around.

Clerk: Sure. Just let me know if you have other questions.

### 0214 A Jealous Girlfriend

Sarya: Hey Dom, I haven’t seen you in so long. Where have you been?

Dominick: Oh, I’ve been busy.

Sarya: I’ve missed hanging out together. How’s Leslie?

Dominick: She’s okay, but things haven’t been that great between us.

Sarya: I’m really sorry to hear that. What’s up?

Dominick: Leslie is great, but she’s so jealous of my friends, especially my female friends. She doesn’t like it when I see them or even if I talk to them on the phone. To be honest, that’s why I haven’t called you lately.

Sarya: I got the feeling that you’ve been avoiding me. Now I understand that it’s the green-eyed monster at work. Have you been doing anything to make her jealous?

Dominick: No! I go out with my friends sometimes but I’m always up front with Leslie and tell her what I’m doing. But, she’s so possessive. Even when I go out with my guy friends, she flips out sometimes. I don’t know why she won’t trust me.

Sarya: Maybe she’s just insecure about herself, or maybe she feels insecure about your relationship. But either way, I’d stop this in its tracks before it gets any worse. Have you talked to her about it?

Dominick: Not really. We usually get into a big fight and then we make up, but we don’t ever get at the root of the matter.

Sarya: I wish I could help.

Dominick: You already have. Talking about it helps. Whatever it takes, I’m going to get this under control. Other than this jealousy problem, we have a great relationship. I don’t want anything to jeopardize it.

Sarya: Good luck with everything and let me know if I there’s anything I can do.

Dominick: Thanks. I will.

### 0215 Getting a Men’s Haircut

It’s been almost three months since I got a haircut and I went to the barbershop where I always get it cut. But when I got there, the barbershop had been replaced by a hair salon.

Shinobu: Hi, I used to get my hair cut at the barbershop that was here.

Nicole: Yeah, they closed. We’ve been open for about a month. I can cut your hair.

Shinobu: Uh...I guess that’s okay.

Nicole: Why don’t you come over here and sit down. What do you have in mind?

Shinobu: Well, as you can see, my hair is pretty curly. When it’s long, it looks like an Afro. I want it to be a lot shorter, but I don’t want a buzz cut.

Nicole: Are you sure you want to cut it? If you keep it long, you could have great dreadlocks.

Shinobu: Uh, I’m not sure that that style would work for me.

Nicole: Okay, then. How about if I cut it short on the sides, leave the bangs medium length, and then keep the back long?

Shinobu: No, I don’t think that would work, either. I’d like it an inch off the collar in back, above the ears, no sideburns, with a part down the right side. I really just need a trim.

Nicole: Hmm…how about if I shave your head? You’d look great bald.

Shinobu: No! I definitely don’t want that. You know what, I just remembered that I’m supposed to be somewhere else right now.

Nicole: Oh, are you sure? I’m sure I know exactly what you want.

Shinobu: I’m sure you do, but I really have to go.

I left that hair salon as quickly as I could. Who knows what would have happened if I’d stayed there? She may have given me a Mohawk!

### 0216 Outsourcing Operations

Bonnie: I wanted us to meet today to talk about ways to reduce our overhead. One suggestion is for us to outsource some of our operations. I’d like to hear what you think are the pros and cons of doing that.

Jean-Luc: I think that, in principle, it’s a good idea. It would save us a lot of money, but I see a downside. We would lose control of some of our key in house operations.

Bonnie: Well, I think that we want to focus on non-core operations, such as IT or accounting. I know that other companies have outsourced their call centers, but that would take a lot of training, especially with our call volume.

Jean-Luc: I completely agree. I don’t think that the call center needs to be micro-managed, but it does take more oversight than IT or accounting for quality control, especially if we decide to go offshore.

Bonnie: Okay, I think we’re thinking along the same lines. Let’s call a meeting with the rest of the staff to get their thoughts. How about next Tuesday at 10 a.m.?

Jean-Luc: That works for me. I’ll send out an email out to everybody today.

### 0217 Lost and Found

Airport employee: Hello, Portland Airport, Lost and Found.

Lucas: Hello. I was a passenger on a SunCal Airlines flight yesterday and I think I left my keys on the plane.

Airport employee: I see. To claim the item, you have to fill out a claim form. What did you lose again? Some luggage? You’ll need your claim receipt to get your luggage.

Lucas: No, I lost some keys on the airplane. Keys. I think I left them on my seat. Is it possible to find out if anyone has turned them in to your office?

Airport employee: I don’t know. Can you describe them?

Lucas: Well, they’re on a key chain and there are eight keys on it, including a car key.

Airport employee: Was there anything distinctive about the key chain? You’ll need to prove ownership if you want to claim them.

Lucas: No, it’s a plain key ring. Maybe I should come down to the office to see if I can identify them. What happens to property that’s unclaimed?

Airport employee: We keep it for 30 days and then we dispose of it. Don’t worry. We don’t have a policy of finders, keepers. If you lost some luggage, it’ll turn up.

Lucas: No, I lost some keys! Keys! Never mind. I’m coming down right now.

Airport employee: That’s a good idea. It’s easier to pick up your lost luggage than for us to send it.

Lucas: Uh!

### 0218 Getting a Driver's License

Jane: Hey, Henry. You look busy. What's that you're reading?

Henry: Oh, hi, Jane. I'm studying the driver's manual so I can finally get my driver's license. I just hope I can remember all these traffic laws.

Jane: I’m sure you’ll pass the tests with flying colors, especially since you can miss a few and still pass. Just don't forget to bring your glasses with you so you don’t fail the vision test.

Henry: Yeah, I know. I think the written test will be okay, but I’m really worried about the road test. I never took driver’s ed and I’m nervous behind the wheel. My brother failed his test the first time because he forgot to signal a left turn, and then he didn't yield to a pedestrian. He also screwed up on the parallel parking.

Jane: It sounds like he just got nervous. A busy intersection is always tricky. So when's your appointment at the DMV?

Henry: Next Tuesday. But I might just go in earlier and take the test as a walk-in.

Jane: Can't wait, huh? Well, I'll let you get back to studying. Good luck!

Henry: Thanks. See you around.

### 0219 Giving Compliments

A friend from work, Nia, asked a few of us over to her apartment to watch the game this Sunday and I was really nervous. I’ve always liked Nia and I was hoping we could be more than friends. My brother, Charlie, said that if I really liked her, I should be sure to give her plenty of compliments when I saw her.

I arrived on Sunday and knocked on her door.

Nia: Hi, I’m glad you could make it. You’re the first one here. Make yourself comfortable.

Sebastian: Thanks and you look great. Red looks great on you.

Nia: Oh, thanks. It’s nice to be out of work clothes. Can I get you something to drink?

Sebastian: Sure. What are you having?

Nia: I’m just having a beer. Want one?

Sebastian: Sure. What a cool place! This is a really nice apartment.

Nia: Here you go. Actually, I just moved in last month and I’m still decorating. But, that’s nice of you to say.

Sebastian: Wow, nice picture. Did you paint this?

Nia: No, I didn’t. Someone named Picasso did. It’s just a copy. You know, I really appreciate the compliments, but what’s up?

Sebastian: Up? Nothing. I’m just glad to be here.

Nia: Well, I’m glad you’re here, too. Now, drink up. The others should be here any minute.

Sebastian: Sure. Cheers!

### 0220 Giving Opinions in a Meeting

I was in a department meeting and our manager was asking for our feedback on improving our product. I had a few ideas and I wanted to get them across, but one of my colleagues was giving me a hard time.

Marcelo: In my opinion, I think that we need to look at the question more from the customer’s perspective. I really feel we need to do more market research.

Ellen: I tend to think that we have enough information already and it’s time to make some decisions.

Marcelo: Well, the way I see it, we’ve only scratched the surface in getting to know our customers. We need to get inside their heads if we want to offer what they want and aren’t getting right now.

Ellen: You may be right, but if you ask me, I just don’t think it’s worth it to sink more time and money into the type of market research you’re proposing. It’s far more than what other companies are doing.

Marcelo: That’s precisely my point. I’m sure that if we can get information that other companies don’t have, we’ll be one step ahead.

That’s when the manager stepped in and offered her opinion. And, I’m happy to say, she sided with me.

### 0221 Long Distance Relationships

I met Diana last year when we were both working in New York City for the summer. I’m finishing college in California and Diana started her first job in Florida. Talk about a bicoastal relationship! We spent three great months together and we’ve been trying to maintain a long distance relationship ever since. It’s been really hard and I had a talk about it with my friend, Emily, who just got out of a relationship like this.

Enrique: I’m always worried that for her, it’s out of sight, out of mind.

Emily: I know what you mean, but is it that way with you?

Enrique: No, not at all. I think about her all the time. It’s not that there aren’t temptations, but I’m committed to Diana.

Emily: Don’t you get the same vibe from her?

Enrique: Sometimes I do, but a lot of times I don’t. It’s so easy to get into a fight on the phone. We have misunderstandings all the time or I hurt her feelings without realizing it. And plus, I’m still in school and she’s already out working, and it seems like we’re growing apart.

Emily: That’s what happened with Theo and me. We grew apart and we had less and less in common. After a year, we called it quits.

Enrique: I hope that’s not what Diana wants. I’ve got to have it out with her. If she wants to end this, then I’ll just have to deal with it.

Emily: It’s always better to know where you stand. Let me know how it goes.

Enrique: Sure. See you later.

### 0222 Alternative Medicine

I have been suffering from back pain for years. I’ve tried several treatments prescribed by my doctor, but nothing has had a lasting effect. I finally decided to try alternative medicine.

My friend, Amelia, swore by acupuncture. She said that her knee pain went away after only a few weeks of therapy. She was skeptical when she first started, but she knew after only a few sessions that it was working for her and that this was no New Age nonsense. She thought it might work for me, too.

My co-worker, Ray, suggested that I try some homeopathic treatments. He said that taking herbal supplements that are all natural has helped him recover after getting injured on the job a couple of months ago. He took these as complementary to the traditional medication his doctor gave him. He said that even though the herbs he takes haven’t undergone clinical trials, his own experience told him that they work.

I’m a little nervous about trying these unorthodox treatments, but after hearing about Amelia’s and Ray’s experiences, I’m willing to give them a try. Nothing has worked so far, so what do I have to lose?

### 0223 A Mistake in the Hotel Bill

Hotel clerk: Here’s the bill for your four-night stay. Would you like the incidentals charged to your credit card?

May: Incidentals? I think there’s some mistake. I didn’t order any pay-per-view movies and I never ordered room service. And, I didn’t have any spa services, either.

Hotel clerk: Are you sure? We show three movies and two room service orders.

May: I’m positive. Could I speak to a supervisor, please?

Hotel clerk: He’s not on duty right now, but let me see if I can resolve this for you. How many of these charges were made in error?

May: All of them. Is it possible that my bill was switched with another room’s? As I said, I didn’t order any movies, I haven’t had any room service, and I haven’t visited the spa since I checked in to the hotel.

Hotel clerk: I see. I’ll need to check with each of those departments to determine whether a mistake has been made.

May: How long will this take?

Hotel clerk: Not long, I’m sure. If you could take a seat in the lobby...

May: I have a plane to catch and I don’t have a lot of time. Is there a general manager I can speak to?

Hotel clerk: I’m not sure. If you’ll have a seat, I’ll see if I can get Ms. Cardenes for you.

May: Thank you. I’d appreciate it.

### 0224 Holiday Promotions

My boss asked me to come up with some holiday promotion ideas so that we can make inroads into the gift-buying market. For us to stay competitive, our company has to increase retail sales for this important sales cycle. My boss is expecting some innovative ideas from me.

Since we’re an online business and not a brick-and-mortar store, we can’t just put signs in the window or do other types of traditional advertising. Lucky for us, though, consumers are increasingly computer savvy and are more likely than ever to buy online. That’s something we want to capitalize on.

Like other companies, we’re willing to slash prices to attract holiday shoppers. We have a large inventory and we don’t have to worry about running out of stock. The trick is, how do we increase sales without resorting to gimmicks? Dressing up salespeople to look like Santa Claus may work for some businesses but not ours.

I’m just hoping that I can come up with some fresh ideas to jump-start this sales season. I know that my boss is counting on me.

### 0225 Feeling Homesick

Annie: Why the long face?

Luis: I don’t know. I guess I’m feeling a little homesick.

Annie: I thought you got over that. I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but I thought you were coping pretty well.

Luis: I was. It’s just that the holidays are coming up and I won’t be able to go home because I can’t afford the airfare. I’m just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom’s cooking and being around my family.

Annie: Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I’d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. But, you know, I think I was just seeing things through rose-colored glasses.

Luis: What do you mean?

Annie: Well, things back home weren’t really that idyllic, but from this distance, all I could think of was the good stuff and none of the bad.

Luis: I see what you mean, but I’m still bummed out.

Annie: I have an idea. Why don’t we put on our own little holiday celebration? We can have it at my place and we can invite all of our friends who are on their own this time of year. We’ll each do something that’ll remind us of home. What do you say? Misery loves company, as they say.

Luis: You know, I could really go for that. You don’t mind all of the trouble?

Annie: What trouble? As long as I don’t have to cook, I’m up for it.

Luis: Cool. I’ll ask around to see who else wants to come.

Annie: Okay. I’ll do the same.

Luis: Thanks. I’m feeling better already.

### 0226 Holiday Decorating

Now that the holidays are here, it’s time to decorate the house. Every year, we always go all out. We buy a Christmas tree and the kids decorate it with ornaments that we’ve bought and made over the years, and with silver and gold tinsel. We also hang a wreath on our front door and I make sure that there’s mistletoe above every door. Around the chimney, we hang our stockings, and when we get holiday cards from our friends and neighbors, we put them all around the room.

Outside of the house, we have lawn ornaments that we put in the front yard. People who visit our house will see snowmen (and snowwomen), reindeer, and of course, Santa Claus. The best part is the outdoor lights. I string them across the front of the house, around our trees, and in our fence. When I turn them all on, you can probably see our house from miles away. It’s no wonder that people come from all over town just to see our house at night. I have to say that I enjoy the holiday season as much as the kids...and maybe just a little more!

### 0227 Describing Symptoms to a Doctor

Dr. van Eyck: Good morning, I’m Dr. van Eyck. I understand that you’re not feeling well.

Nico: That’s right, doctor. I’ve had a stomachache for three days. The pain comes and goes, but I also have heartburn and I am feeling bloated all the time.

Dr. van Eyck: Well, let’s take a look. Have you felt nauseous? Does it hurt when I press here?

Nico: Oh yes, that hurts, and I feel nauseous all the time. But, doctor, that’s not all. I’ve also had bad headaches in the past week and I feel fatigued all the time.

Dr. van Eyck: Have you had a stuffy nose, a cough, a sore throat, or an earache?

Nico: Yes, I’ve had all of those.

Dr. van Eyck: You have? All of them?

Nico: And, there’s more. I’ve been feeling pains in my leg. Sometimes it feels stiff and sometimes I lose feeling in it. I’m having a lot of trouble walking.

Dr. van Eyck: I have to say that you have an unusual combination of symptoms. Have there been any significant changes in your life in the past few days?

Nico: Well, my in-laws are visiting from out of town. Do you think you’ll need to admit me into the hospital for tests?

Dr. van Eyck: I’m not sure that’s necessary. Are things really that bad at home?

Nico: You have no idea!

### 0228 A Christmas Feast

This year, our family decided that the more the merrier and invited Adriano and his family to have Christmas dinner with us. We were thrilled when they accepted our invitation.

Lucy: I’m so glad you guys could all make it.

Adriano: We wouldn’t have missed it for anything. We brought a fruitcake.

Lucy: Oh, thanks. Make yourselves comfortable. We’re just about to sit down to dinner.

Adriano: Wow, it looks like you’ve prepared a feast.

Lucy: Yeah, we did go a little overboard this year. We’ve got a turkey, a roast and a ham, and all the trimmings: stuffing, yams, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce. Help yourself to some eggnog.

Adriano: Thanks. Did you do all of the cooking yourself?

Lucy: I had some help and everybody brought different desserts. Save room for the pumpkin pie, the gingerbread house, and the Christmas cookies. Okay everybody, dinner’s ready. Adriano, would you carve the bird?

Adriano: I’d be happy to do the honors.

### 0229 Irritating Co-workers

Since our office reorganization, I’ve been sharing an office with Isabel. We’ve been getting on each other’s nerves.

Pete: Hey, Isabel, can you cut that out?

Isabel: Cut what out? I’m not doing anything.

Pete: You’re tapping your pencil on your desk. It’s driving me crazy.

Isabel: Okay, I will if you’ll stop slurping your coffee.

Pete: I don’t slurp my coffee. And plus, how can you hear it when you’re shouting into your phone all the time?

Isabel: You’ve got to be kidding me! You’re complaining about me talking on the phone when your friend Deepak stops by ten times a day to shoot the breeze? I can’t stand that guy.

Pete: It’s no skin off my nose if you don’t like Deepak. Look, we have a lot of pent-up anger from working in these close quarters, and it’s probably okay to let off steam once in a while. But, it’s probably not a good idea to keep it up. I’m willing to forgive and forget if you are.

Isabel: Fine. Let’s call a truce. I’ll try to be more considerate and to keep the noise down.

Pete: Yeah, I’ll try to do the same.

### 0230 A New Year’s Cruise

My friends and I decided to do something a little different this year. Instead of going to a crowded club or throwing a party on New Year’s Eve, we decided to take a harbor cruise instead. The cruise would be four hours long, and it included dinner, music, dancing, and a great view of the fireworks.

On that day, we drove to the marina and we were among the first to board the ship. This was no little boat. It was a large ship with an upper and a lower deck. The crew helped us get on board and showed us where the life jackets were in case of an emergency. Even the captain came out to welcome the passengers.

We had a great time. I didn’t get seasick as I’d feared, and we didn’t have to call out the Coast Guard, either. We had so much fun, we didn’t want to go back on shore. Finally, the captain joked that if we didn’t leave, he’d make us walk the plank!

### 0231 The Supermarket Checkout

I went to the supermarket to do my weekly shopping. The cashiers at this market are usually pretty friendly, but this one must have been having a hard day.

Cashier: Excuse me, sir, this lane is for 15 items or less. It looks like you have more than that.

Yong: No, actually I have exactly 15. I have some coupons, too.

Cashier: Just put those down on the belt and push the cart through, please.

Yong: Okay. Can you tell me how much these potatoes are per pound?

Cashier: I’ll have to do a price check. Do you have a club card?

Yong: Yes, here it is.

Cashier: Swipe it through the machine, sir. Your total is $47.52. Debit or credit?

Yong: Debit. Could I get cash back?

Cashier: [sigh] How much do you want?

Yong: I’d like $40.

Cashier: Paper or plastic?

Yong: Paper, please.

Cashier: Are these tabloids yours, too?

Yong: Uh, yes, those magazines are mine.

Cashier: Do you need any help out?

Yong: No, I’m fine. Thanks.

### 0232 Business Bookkeeping

I have a day job, but I recently started a small business on the side. I didn’t know anything about accounting and my friend, Roland, said that he would give me some advice.

Roland: So, the reason that you need to do your bookkeeping is so you can manage your cash flow. Even if you have a lot of orders, you may still have problems paying your bills.

Magdalena: I see what you mean. Is this the kind of ledger I should be keeping?

Roland: Yes, definitely. You want to list your debits on this side and your credits on this side. This will help you figure out important things like your break-even point, your assets and liabilities, your administrative expenses, and whether you’re staying within your budget.

Magdalena: I wish I had an accounts payable department to help me with all this. I don’t even know how to create a balance sheet.

Roland: It’s not that hard if you use the right accounting program. The first thing to do is to keep track of your expenses. How do you do that now?

Magdalena: Oh, I have a system. I keep all my receipts in this bag.

Roland: Oh. Well, it’s good that you’re keeping your receipts but you’ll have to keep better track of them. What would you do if you were audited by the IRS?

Magdalena: Don’t even mention the IRS! I’ve got enough problems without worrying about them!

### 0233 Asking for a Date

I admit it. I’m a player. I work in an office where there are a lot of attractive women. Take Debra, for example. I heard that she just broke up with her boyfriend last week so I decided to ask her out.

Liam: Hi, Debra. How’s it going?

Debra: Okay, I guess. How about you?

Liam: I’m doing okay. You know, I’m going to an art show this Saturday. Would you like to come with me?

Debra: Geez, I’m pretty busy this weekend.

Liam: That’s too bad. How about going for a drink after work today?

Debra: Well, I don’t know...

Liam: Come on. It’ll be fun and we can try that new place down the street.

Debra: I guess that’ll be okay, but just a drink, right?

Liam: That’s all and I promise I won’t even try to buy you dinner.

Debra: [laughs] Okay, then. I’ll see you after work.

I ask women out wherever I see them, even ones I’ve never met before. At a restaurant, if I see a woman eating by herself, I usually say: “I just hate eating alone. Do you mind if I join you?” The other day, I saw a woman at the grocery store and tried my luck.

Liam: Hi.

Monica: Hi.

Liam: I’ve just moved to this area and was wondering if you could recommend a good restaurant around here.

Monica: That depends on what kind of food you like. There’s a good Italian restaurant on Elm Street, or there’s a good Thai place on Lyndon Avenue.

Liam: Which one do you prefer?

Monica: I like them both, but I’d probably go for the Italian place.

Liam: In that case, would you like to join me for dinner sometime?

Monica: I’m not sure. I don’t even know you.

Liam: You’re right, but you seem really nice and I’d like to get to know you better. What do you say?

Monica: Well, maybe. Here’s my number. Call me and we’ll talk about it.

Liam: I’ll do that. I’m looking forward to talking with you again.

It’s as easy as that. I don’t try to be a player. All it takes is a little charm and a little flattery, and women will find you irresistible.

### 0234 Seeing an Eye Doctor

I’ve been getting a lot of headaches the past few weeks and my co-worker suggested I go see an optometrist.

Dr. Olho: Okay, let’s take a look. Do you wear glasses or contacts?

Virginia: I used to, but I had laser eye surgery three years ago and I don’t wear them anymore.

Dr. Olho: I see. Well, let’s check your vision. It may be that even though your vision was 20/20 after the surgery, it’s changed and you are now either near-sighted or far-sighted. Cover your left eye and take a look at the eye chart. Read the last line that you can make out.

Virginia: I can read the fourth line down – X, C, D, O, M, A.

Dr. Olho: Hmmm...okay. Cover your other eye and do the same. Good. I’m going to have you look through this machine and I want you to tell me if A or B is sharper and clearer. Okay, A or B, A or B?

Virginia: A is a little blurry. I think B is better.

Dr. Olho: Okay, I think that you’ve developed some far-sightedness and will need reading glasses. I’m writing out a prescription for you. When you’ve picked out a frame, give them the prescription and they’ll make your lenses. Any questions?

Virginia: So, do you really think I need reading glasses? I’m not that old.

Dr. Olho: I’m sorry to say that you do. Some people have to get them earlier than others. At least you’re not having any serious eye problems like glaucoma.

Virginia: Yeah, I guess that’s one thing to be grateful for.

### 0235 Parking Instructions

I arrived for my meeting at the headquarters of Woon Enterprises and I stopped at the kiosk to ask for directions. It’s a huge organization and the offices are located on a 30-acre compound, so it’s very hard to find your way around without some help.

Guard: Good morning.

Edyta: Good morning. I’m here for a meeting with Mark Johnson. Could you tell me how to get to the right building?

Guard: Sure. Take this road and follow the bend to the right. When you see the fork in the road, take the road on your right. Follow that to the parking structure. You can’t miss it.

Edyta: Okay, so when the road splits, I should veer right.

Guard: That’s right. Here’s a guest parking permit. Make sure it’s visible on your dash at all times. Drive past the lot and go into the parking structure. You can park on any level and in any space that isn’t reserved. The building right next to the structure is where Mark Johnson’s office is.

Edyta: Thanks, I think I’ve got all that.

The guard raised the arm of the gate and let me through. As I drove through the huge compound to the parking structure, I couldn’t help thinking that this Woon must be one very successful businessman.

### 0236 An On-Site Estimate

I work for a building contractor and I spend most of my workday giving on-site estimates. I mainly go to people’s homes, discuss the work they want done, inspect the site, and give them a quote.

Robert: You want to expand your kitchen, is that right?

Abigail: Yes, with our growing family, we need more room.

Robert: It looks like it’s about 200 square feet right now. You want to double the size?

Abigail: That’s the idea, but I want to get it done quickly, say within two months. Is that possible?

Robert: Well, we’ve finished jobs like this before in under three months, but that’s without any delays. Sometimes getting the exact materials the client wants or finding structural problems that don’t appear until we start work can set us back.

Abigail: That’s my greatest fear. I’m afraid of delays and cost overruns.

Robert: Well, we try to be upfront with our clients by giving them a breakdown of the costs of the materials and labor involved in the project. We also give them a schedule of when the work will be completed. You’ll get a detailed estimate in writing, at no charge and with no obligation.

Abigail: How long does it take to get the estimate?

Robert: We usually mail or fax the estimate within two days.

Abigail: That’s great. Let me tell you exactly what we have in mind...

### 0237 Getting Revenge

Jaime: I don’t know what’s wrong with Liam lately. The guy is short-tempered and jumps down my throat about every little thing.

Debra: [laughs]

Jaime: What’s so funny?

Debra: I have a feeling that he’s not getting enough sleep.

Jaime: You don’t mean you and Liam...

Debra: No way! It’s just that the women in this office are paying him back for the way he's treated them, two-timing them and leading them on.

Jaime: Are you serious?

Debra: Yeah, there are quite a few women with an axe to grind and wouldn’t mind getting even with him. You’re not going to tell him, are you?

Jaime: No, I won’t, but what are you doing exactly?

Debra: We’re all taking turns keeping him up at night by calling his home phone and his cell phone, and we’re also ordering food to be delivered at all hours of the night. It’s no wonder he’s feeling a little grouchy.

Jaime: That explains it. It’s no skin off my nose, but isn’t that going overboard?

Debra: Not in the least. If you knew some of the rotten things he’s done, you’d know that it’s no more than he deserves.

Jaime: If you say so. It’s certainly a good reminder that, “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.”

### 0238 Traveling Off-Season

Kavita: What I wouldn’t give to get away for a little vacation!

Bill: Me, too, but we can’t afford it.

Kavita: Oh, I don’t know. It’s off-season in a lot of popular places right now, so it may be doable.

Bill: Maybe. We’d have to find some pretty deep discounts. There is a big advantage to traveling during the low season, though. It’s a lot less crowded.

Kavita: Yeah, I like that. I’ll see if I can find a package deal that includes airfare and lodgings. That may give us the best deal.

Bill: We have one thing going for us. We have flexible travel dates, which should make it easier to take advantage of any special promotions.

Kavita: That’s true. I’m start looking online and I’ll let you know what I find.

Bill: I know what a good bargain hunter you are, so if anyone can find a good deal, it’s you.

Kavita: I’m not at all sure I can find something we can afford, but it won’t be for a lack of trying. I really need that vacation!

### 0239 A Birthday Party

My sister called me at the last minute to help her with my nephew’s birthday party. She was feeling really sick and couldn’t get out of bed. I’d never given a children’s party before, but how hard could it be? Well, I found out.

First, I had to go to the party supply store to get a few things. I couldn’t believe all of the stuff people could buy for children’s parties. There was an aisle with all kinds of party invitations and another one with party favors, streamers, and other decorations. Fortunately, my sister had already bought most of the things we needed earlier in the week. All I needed to pick up were some candles for the birthday cake and some helium balloons.

After the party supply store, I stopped at the grocery store to pick up the birthday cake. My sister had ordered it the week before, so all I had to do was to pay for it and to make sure my nephew’s name was spelled correctly on the top in icing.

Two hours later, I was ready for the party. When the kids arrived with their parents, I took the birthday cards and presents they had brought, and I handed each child some party favors. I was so glad when the clown my sister had hired arrived, and she entertained the kids with games. I have never seen so many kids with so much energy! A little later, we sang “Happy Birthday,” my nephew blew out the candles, and we cut the cake. My nephew opened his presents and the kids played with his new toys. The kids had a good time and so did my nephew.

I have to hand it to my sister. I don’t know how she does it. After three hours with 15 young kids, I’m exhausted and my ears are ringing!

### 0240 Working Overtime

Jeremy: Hello.

Miranda: Hi, it’s me. I can’t make it home for dinner tonight. I’m working overtime.

Jeremy: Again? That’s the third time this week. I can’t believe your boss is making you do this.

Miranda: Don’t get mad, but I actually told him that I didn’t mind. I know I’ve been working long hours, but I don’t want to turn down the work. You know that I’m getting paid time and a half, and we need the money.

Jeremy: I know we do, but we’re getting by. What happened to a 40-hour workweek? You’ve been working at least 60. It’s not worth it for you to work your fingers to the bone no matter how strapped we are.

Miranda: I know. I know. It’s just that morale around this place is pretty low and I’m just trying to do my part. Just don’t gripe. Okay?

Jeremy: I’m not griping. I’m just worried about you. You come home after a long day, and you’re overworked and emotionally drained. That’s not fair to the kids.

Miranda: You’re right, but could we talk about it this weekend? I’ve really got to go. I promise we’ll work it all out then.

Jeremy: Okay, but what time are you coming home tonight?

Miranda: I’m not sure, but I’ll try to make it home in time to tuck the kids in.

Jeremy: All right. I’ll see you then.

Miranda: Bye.

### 0241 At the Bakery

Clerk: Hi, can I help you?

Leticia: Hi. I’m trying to make up my mind about which kind of dessert to get. Everything in the case looks delicious.

Clerk: Thanks. As you can see, we have a lot of different types of cookies, brownies, cakes, and muffins over here.

Leticia: Ooh, that cake looks wonderful. How many people does it serve?

Clerk: This one? It has three layers, and it serves between eight and ten people, depending on how you slice it. If you like chocolate, you may like this one over here with the frosting and sprinkles.

Leticia: Oh, that looks good, too. Hmm. It’s so hard to decide. Why don’t I take the layer cake, and I’d like a dozen of these cookies, too.

Clerk: Our cookies, muffins, and scones always come in baker’s dozens. Can I get you anything else?

Leticia: I think I’d like a bag of those biscotti, too.

Clerk: Sure, no problem. Would you like the cookies and biscotti in the same box as the cake?

Leticia: No. Please put them in separate boxes, if you don’t mind.

Clerk: Not at all. Here you are.

Leticia: Thanks. We’ll be having an overload of sugar for the next few days!

### 0242 The Comedy Club

On Friday night, I went with a group of friends from work to a comedy club. I don’t really like sketch comedy, but I do like stand-up, and the comedian who was going to perform there was one of my favorites.

There were six of us and we were a pretty rowdy group. We stood in line outside, and when we got to the box office window, we paid the cover charge. The hostess showed us to a table right next to the stage and told us that there was a two-drink minimum. She took our drink orders and we waited for the opening act.

The first comic told a lot of political jokes and most of them fell flat. In fact, some of the people seated in the back started to boo him and he got off the stage pretty quickly. The MC came out and tried to get the hecklers to calm down by telling a few jokes of his own, and that did the trick.

The headliner finally came out and the crowd went crazy, clapping and cheering. He did some very funny improv and had us rolling in the aisles. I can’t remember the last time I laughed so hard!

### 0243 Speaking to a Store Clerk on the Phone

Clerk: Hello. Levin’s Music.

Ariel: Hello. I was wondering if you carry classical CD’s.

Clerk: Yes, we have a pretty large selection. What are you looking for?

Ariel: I’m trying to find the latest Reunion Island Ensemble CD.

Clerk: I’m not sure we have that in stock. We have a lot of CD’s on back order. Can I put you on hold while I check?

Ariel: Sure.

Clerk: Okay. We have one copy of their 2005 CD left. Is that the one you’re looking for?

Ariel: Yes, it is. How much is it?

Clerk: Let me check the price. It’s $17.95.

Ariel: That’s great. Could you hold that for me?

Clerk: We can reserve it for you for 24 hours. When you come in, just go to the customer service desk. What’s your name?

Ariel: It’s Ariel, A-R-I-E-L. What are your store hours?

Clerk: We’re open weekdays from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., and 9:00 to 6:00 on weekends.

Ariel: I’ll be in later today to pick that up. Thanks a lot for your help.

Clerk: It’s no problem. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Ariel: No, that’s all. Thanks, again.

Clerk: You’re welcome and thanks for calling Levin’s.

### 0244 Critiquing Someone’s Work

Noriko: Have you had a chance to look over Russ’s project?

Walt: Yeah, I took a look at it yesterday. If you have a couple of minutes, I can give you my two cents.

Noriko: Sure. Shoot.

Walt: Well, it’s not what I envisioned when we gave him the charge to come up with a new design for the brochure. The cover isn’t bad, but I’m not crazy about the rest of it.

Noriko: Why? What don’t you like?

Walt: Well, I think Russ is off the mark to feature our older products, rather than our new ones. When I saw what he had come up with, I thought he was out in left field. We told him to focus on the latest products, didn’t we?

Noriko: Yes, we did tell him that. I haven’t had a chance to look at the brochure closely myself, but I plan to this afternoon. So you think it needs work, huh? A lot of work?

Walt: Let’s just say that there’s a lot of room for improvement. I’d be happy to meet with him to give him my comments, if you think that would help.

Noriko: Why don’t you hold off until I’ve had a chance to go over the brochure this afternoon. I’ll set up a meeting for tomorrow and we can both give him some feedback on how to proceed.

Walt: That’s okay with me. Thanks for taking the reins on this.

Noriko: It’s no big deal. I’ll let you know later today about that meeting.

### 0245 Characteristics of an Ideal Mate

I’ve been trying to set up my good friend, Rachid, with one of my single girlfriends, but I still wasn’t too sure what his type would be.

Tamara: So, tell me what you’re looking for in a woman.

Rachid: She has to be rich and hot!

Tamara: Come on! Be serious.

Rachid: Okay, okay, but I don’t know why married people are always trying to get their single friends married off. Is it because misery loves company?

Tamara: Stop being a smart aleck and answer the question.

Rachid: All right. I’m being serious now. What do I look for in a woman? I’d like someone who has a good sense of humor, someone who is kind-hearted and easy to talk to, and is supportive of me.

Tamara: What about vital statistics? Age, physical type?

Rachid: She has to be pretty, but I’m not too picky about whether she’s a blond, brunette, or redhead. She should be my height or shorter, and around my age or a few years younger or older.

Tamara: That helps a little to narrow down who may be a good match for you. Any deal killers?

Rachid: I don’t like women who are too chatty or who are too bossy. Otherwise, I have a pretty open mind when it comes to women.

Tamara: Okay, I can think of at least a couple of friends who may be willing to put up with you.

Rachid: Put up with me? Are you kidding? I’m a catch!

Tamara: Oh, geez. Finding somebody for you is going to be harder than I thought!

### 0246 Understanding Addresses

I was away from my office and needed to send some letters to clients. Unfortunately, I didn’t have their addresses, so I called the office secretary.

Christina: Hi, Jacob. I need your help getting the mailing addresses for a couple of clients.

Jacob: Sure. Which ones?

Christina: I need addresses for Jim Kelly and for Dr. Uemura.

Jacob: Okay. Jim Kelly’s address is...

Christina: I’m sorry Jacob, but my cell phone cut out and I didn’t hear you. Could you repeat the street address?

Jacob: Sure. It’s 1212 South Peabody Court, Lansing, Michigan, 48908.

Christina: I didn’t catch the end of the address. Did you say boulevard, avenue, or street?

Jacob: It’s actually court, and the street number again is 1212.

Christina: Thanks. I’ve got that. Could you also spell the street name?

Jacob: Sure. It’s P-E-A-B-O-D-Y. You know what? I see a note here that he’s in North Dakota until June. Let me give you that address. Mail should be sent to him in care of or to the attention of The Letty Institute, P.O. Box 345, Fargo, North Dakota, 58102.

Christina: Got it. How about an address for Dr. Uemura?

Jacob: Here it is. It’s 300 Goodman Building, University of Massachusetts, 234 Hitch Way, Amherst, Massachusetts.

Christina: Do you have the zip plus four?

Jacob: It’s 01003-9272.

Christina: Oh, I just realized that I only have Dr. Uemura’s last name. I want to include his first name, too, on the addressee line. Can you look that up for me?

Jacob: I’ve got it right here. His first name is Brent.

Christina: Thanks a lot, Jacob. You’ve been a big help.

Jacob: Don’t mention it.

### 0247 Asking for Recommendations

Hotel Clerk: Can I help you with something?

Victor: Yes, I was hoping you could recommend a restaurant nearby.

Clerk: What kind of food would you like?

Victor: I’m not picky. I’m looking for something moderately priced that’s within walking distance.

Clerk: There’s a good seafood restaurant called “Galeno’s” about two blocks away. Would you like me to make a reservation for you?

Victor: Thanks, but that won’t be necessary. I need to check with my guest before deciding. By the way, I’ll be in town for four days, and I’d like to see the sights.

Clerk: Is this your first time here?

Victor: Yes, it is.

Clerk: Then, I’d suggest seeing our museums and the botanical gardens, and don’t miss the shopping district near downtown.

Victor: Can I get there on foot?

Clerk: I’m afraid not. You can take a taxi or a bus. We have a very good bus system. The other option is to take a tour. There are several tour companies that have day tours leaving from this hotel. Help yourself to their brochures. They’re over there.

Victor: Do you have a map showing where those sights are?

Clerk: Sure. Here you are. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Victor: No, that’s all. You’ve been a big help. Thanks.

### 0248 Business Websites

I was hired to set up a website for a small bookstore and the owner knew very little about the Internet. I tried to find out what she wanted for her business website.

Octavio: Let me show you some websites I’ve designed. I have them all bookmarked. Okay, this is a website for a restaurant. As you can see, the homepage is fairly simple. The menu bar on the left-hand side allows visitors to navigate around the site.

Margaret: I like this layout a lot. Why are these words in a different color?

Octavio: Those are hyperlinks to other pages on the website. If you click on the text or the image, you’ll be taken to a different page.

Margaret: Oh, I see, so for my site, I can list the books I have for sale, and we can hyperlink each book title to a description of that book.

Octavio: Yes, that’s right. You’ll probably also want a search function so that people can type in the name of a book or the author to find out if you carry a specific book.

Margaret: Yes, definitely. Does it matter which browser customers use to look at my website?

Octavio: No, I’ll make sure that it’s compatible with all of the major browsers out there.

Margaret: Will people need to type in “www” before the web address?

Octavio: No, they should be able to just type in the name of the store and the domain, which in your case would be “.com.”

Margaret: Since I know so little about the Internet, do I have to learn HTML or some other type of computer language to maintain the site?

Octavio: No, not at all. Your website will have content management software installed that allows you to make basic changes. Once it’s done, I’ll show you how to use it. Should we look at a few more websites to get some other ideas for your site?

Margaret: That’s a great idea. Let’s do that.

### 0249 At a Casino

Hanna: Where have you been? I’ve been trying to find you. I just won $80 from this slot machine. It’s not the jackpot, but now I’ve broken even.

Tad: That’s really great. Maybe some of your luck will rub off on me. I’m just about to see what the high rollers are doing. Do you want to come with me to check out the blackjack tables or roulette?

Hanna: I’m not that good at those high-stakes games, where people bet hundreds of dollars on a single play! I’d like to get the comps they get, but I don’t have that kind of money to gamble with.

Tad: Yeah, I wish I had somebody rich to bankroll me, too.

Hanna: I’ll just come and watch you play. You know, I wish I knew how to count cards. Then, I might try my hand at poker.

Tad: Don’t even think about counting cards. If you get caught, you’d get kicked out of this casino in a minute. Hey, there’s a poker tournament going on over there. I want to go watch that later. But first, I want to get my hands on some chips or some dice. I’m feeling lucky.

Hanna: Let’s go.

### 0250 Cheating on a Test

Oscar: What are you doing?

Elena: I’m getting ready for the test.

Oscar: By writing the answers on a cheat sheet? You’re not going to get away with that.

Elena: I got a “D” on the last test and I have to do better on this one. If I don’t get at least a “B,” I’m going to flunk this class.

Oscar: You’re taking a big risk. You could get suspended or expelled!

Elena: I know, but my final grade is on the line. And plus, I think that the worst that could happen is that I get an automatic “F” on the test. It’s not like I’m stealing a copy of the test or plagiarizing on an important assignment.

Oscar: Still, there’s no telling what Mr. McQuillan will do to you if he finds out. I’d let you copy off my test if I thought we could get away with it, but he always keeps a close eye on us during tests. That’s why I think you’re going to get caught.

Elena: It’s not like I have any choice, do I? It’s either cheating or going to summer school.

Oscar: I still think it’s a bad idea.

Elena: Then, just don’t think about it. Let me worry about it, okay?

### 0251 Stranger on an Airplane

Fay: Excuse me. I’m in the window seat.

Dustin: Oh, sure. Let me get up and let you in.

Fay: Thanks.

Dustin: Are you traveling on business?

Fay: Yes, I am. I’m changing planes in Denver on my way to South Carolina, and then I’m off to Georgia on Wednesday. There’s no rest for the wicked.

Dustin: That’s a lot of traveling. Doesn’t your husband or boyfriend mind?

Fay: Oh, I’m not married or seeing anyone. How about you? Where are you headed?

Dustin: I’m going to Jacksonville, Florida to visit my parents for a few days, but I’ll be back in Los Angeles by next weekend. Are you from L.A. originally?

Fay: No, I was born and raised in Kentucky, but I’ve been living in L.A. for the past four years. What part of L.A. do you live in?

Dustin: I live not too far from the airport in Westchester. Have you heard of it?

Fay: That’s a coincidence! I just rented an apartment in Westchester and I’m moving in when I get back. With all of this traveling, it made sense to move closer to the airport.

Dustin: That seems like a wise move. You know, since I’m in the neighborhood, let me know if you need any help moving. I’d also be happy to show you around and give you the rundown on some of the better restaurants in the area. Here’s my card. The number on the bottom is my cell phone.

Fay: Thanks. That would really be nice. By the way, I’m Fay.

Dustin: I’m Dustin. It’s nice to meet you.

Fay: You, too.

### 0252 A Workers Strike

Masako: I think we should strike. We need to force management to listen to our grievances.

Salvador: Hold on. I think you’re being too hasty. It’s up to our union to call a strike, not the workers.

Masako: I’m not suggesting a formal strike, but we could organize a sickout. That would send a message that we mean business.

Salvador: Yeah, but that may also get their backs up. We need to give collective bargaining a chance to get us the contract we want.

Masako: The union has been negotiating for two months and things have stalled. We need to do something to put pressure on the company to come to our terms. At the very least, we should picket outside the building.

Salvador: We should only do that if there’s a strike. We don’t want to make employees feel like they’re crossing the picket line every time they come to work. That would be bad for morale.

Masako: Nobody’s going to feel like a scab if they all know why we’re picketing. Let’s call a meeting and see what everyone else thinks.

Salvador: You can do that if you want, but count me out. I’m going to let the union do its job.

### 0253 Traveling by Train

Katerina: Hey, Joel. Have you ever traveled by train?

Joel: Only once, and that was a long time ago when I lived in Orlando. I’m not even sure where the train station is in this city. Why do you ask?

Katerina: I need to go to San Francisco at the end of May for a friend’s wedding, and I’m thinking about taking a train instead of flying.

Joel: That’s a long trip from Chicago, with a lot of stops. How many days does it take to get there?

Katerina: I just printed out the timetable. Let me see...It looks like it’ll take about four-and-a-half days. I would depart, say, on Tuesday morning and arrive on Saturday afternoon.

Joel: Can I see that? It looks like there are good on-board services, with a dining car and a lounge car on each train.

Katerina: Yeah, I like that. I don’t know if I should go coach or business class. I suppose that’ll depend on the fare. I’ve heard that the sleeping cars are pretty comfortable, too, so I’m glad about that.

Joel: What day of the week do you have to leave?

Katerina: Let me look at the days of operation. This service runs daily, so that’s convenient. I’m going to look online to see how much it’ll cost. It’ll be nice to take a train for a change.

Joel: Let me know what you find out and what you decide. Maybe I’ll look into it for my trip to Washington in September.

### 0254 Good Hygiene

Juanita: Hey, where have you been? I was going to invite you to lunch, but you weren’t at your desk.

Bill: I was at a training.

Juanita: What was it on?

Bill: Office hygiene.

Juanita: Hygiene? You’re kidding. Your office is pretty messy but I wouldn’t say you needed hygiene training.

Bill: Very funny. Each department has to go through it. You’ll have your turn next week. Apparently, the management wants to reduce the spread of illnesses around the office. They say that people are taking too many sick days and it’s bad for productivity.

Juanita: So, we all have to sit through a training. What a pain! It’s not like we don’t know how to wash our hands.

Bill: Yeah, I know. The trainer did a pretty good job, though, explaining how germs spread around the office. It’s easy to infect other people when you have a cold or something else that’s contagious. She said that viruses get around pretty easily. She gave us some pointers on how to prevent it, though.

Juanita: Well, I use antibacterial soap all the time, so I don’t worry about it.

Bill: You know, the trainer said that those soaps may not be that effective. People think they’re sterilizing their hands, but they may be doing more harm than good.

Juanita: Really? I’ve never heard that before.

Bill: Then you’d better go to the training. I guess you need it more than I do.

Juanita: Yeah, very funny.

### 0255 Questions About a Product

Paul: Could you help me? I have a few questions about this computer printer.

Clerk: Sure. I’ll try.

Paul: What I’m wondering is whether this machine can be used as a copier as well as a printer.

Clerk: Yeah, it can. This is a multifunction machine. It can be used as a printer, copier, and a fax machine.

Paul: Can you show me how that works?

Clerk: Well, it’s pretty straightforward. Just hook it up to your computer and you can use it like any other printer. If you want to make copies, just put the document on the glass or in the feeder and press this button.

Paul: That seems pretty simple. How do I use it as a fax machine?

Clerk: Just put the document in the feeder like you would for copying, but instead of pushing the “copy” button, press the “fax” button. Make sure it’s hooked up to a phone line, of course.

Paul: Okay. I think I’ve got it. Does this model come with a warranty?

Clerk: All of the machines made by this company have a one-year warranty against defects. If there’s a problem with it, the manufacturer will repair or replace it.

Paul: That’s good. If I change my mind or decide it’s not what I want, can I return it?

Clerk: You can return the item for an exchange or a refund within 30 days.

Paul: Is there a restocking fee?

Clerk: No, we don’t have a restocking fee. Just make sure you have your receipt.

Paul: I think those are all the questions I had. I appreciate your help.

Clerk: You’re welcome. Let me know if you have other questions.

### 0256 Looking for Ideas

Ling: Ugh!

Sam: What’s the matter?

Ling: I’m trying to jot down some ideas for the meeting tomorrow but I’m drawing a blank.

Sam: When I’ve got a block, I usually step away from it for a while and come back to it later. Then I can look at it with a fresh perspective.

Ling: I don’t have time to take a break. I need to come up with something quick or I’ll have to go into that meeting empty-handed. I can’t let Danielle show me up again. At the last meeting, all of the department heads loved her ideas and they’re starting to think she walks on water.

Sam: Well, I don’t think it helps to sit around worrying about it. Nothing will come to you if you work yourself up too much.

Ling: You’re right. I’m too wound up to think straight. It’s like my brain is in a fog.

Sam: Come on. We’ll go take a quick walk. I’m sure that’ll do the trick. If it doesn’t, I’ll help you work on your resume.

Ling: Gee, thanks. I’ve known all along that you’re after my job.

Sam: Me? After your job? I wouldn’t touch your job with a 10-foot pole. I couldn’t take the pressure. I prefer being a lowly employee and giving you a hard time everyday.

Ling: Thanks a lot. Between you and Danielle, my days here are numbered.

Sam: Come on. Let’s go before you get even more depressed!

### 0257 Finding a Book at a Bookstore

Clerk: Can I help you find something?

Adrian: Yes. Can you tell me where the non-fiction books are?

Clerk: Are you looking for hardbacks or paperbacks?

Adrian: I’m not sure. I think hardbacks.

Clerk: Well, the non-fiction new releases are at the front of the store. The non-fiction section is behind the fiction shelves on your right. The hardbacks are on the top shelves and the paperbacks on the bottom ones. Is there a specific book I can help you find?

Adrian: I’m looking for an old book and I’m not sure of the title. It’s something like, “The Literary Crisis.”

Clerk: Do you know the name of the author?

Adrian: No, I don’t. I saw it mentioned online and I actually wrote down the ISBN, but I can’t find it now.

Clerk: Well, if it’s an old book, it may be out-of-print, but let me look it up in our system. If it was a bestseller at one time, there’s a chance that it’s still in print. Let me check…Okay, here it is. It was published in 1982, and unfortunately, it is out-of-print. You may want to try a used bookstore, like Bookwoman’s down the street.

Adrian: Thanks, I’ll give them a try. I’m also looking for a biography. Can you tell me where they are?

Clerk: Sure. The biographies are behind the reference section over there. Let me know if you need any more help.

Adrian: Thanks. I appreciate it.

### 0258 Moving in Together

My girlfriend and I have been going out for a year and I thought it was time to have a heart-to-heart with her.

Simon: I have something I want to talk to you about. Can you come over here and sit down for a minute?

Paula: Uh oh. Is something wrong?

Simon: No, nothing’s wrong. In fact, everything’s right. We’ve been together for a year and I’ve been happier than I’ve ever been.

Paula: Me, too. Things are going great. What is this all about?

Simon: I want us to move things to the next level. I want us to move in together.

Paula: Simon, I love you, but we can’t do that. You know how conservative my parents are. They would never approve.

Simon: They like me, don’t they?

Paula: It’s not a matter of whether they like you or not. They both adore you as much as I do. But two people moving in together before they’re married goes against their beliefs and mine.

Simon: But don’t you want to?

Paula: I’m very happy with you, but I want things to go on as they are. We spend so much time together anyway, we’re almost joined at the hip.

Simon: Are you saying you want more space?

Paula: No! What I’m saying is that I don’t want to rock the boat when things are going so well. Why don’t we hold off on any more talk about moving in together.

Simon: I suppose that’s okay - for now.

### 0259 Making a Restaurant Reservation

Hostess: Thank you for calling Sakia Restaurant. How may I help you?

Randy: I’d like to make a reservation.

Hostess: For which day and for what time?

Randy: It’s for Friday, the 24th, at seven o’clock.

Hostess: How many will be in the party?

Randy: There will be seven of us.

Hostess: And the name on the reservation?

Randy: Johnson.

Hostess: And a phone number where we can reach you?

Randy: 310-555-9023.

Hostess: Okay. Let me repeat back to you the information I have. This is a reservation for the Friday after next for seven at seven p.m. Is that correct?

Randy: Yes, that’s right. Can we have a table by the window in a non-smoking section? I want to be away from the kitchen, if possible.

Hostess: Our restaurant is all non-smoking. We can’t guarantee a window table, but I’ll note your preference.

Randy: Okay, that’s fine. What’s the parking situation at the restaurant?

Hostess: We have a parking lot behind the restaurant, and we also have valet parking. Do any of the guests have special needs?

Randy: I’m glad you asked. I’ll need two high chairs and four booster seats.

Hostess: I’m sorry, but did you say two high chairs and four booster seats?

Randy: Yes, I did. I’m taking all of my nieces and nephews out to dinner.

Hostess: That sounds nice. It should be a lively evening.

Randy: You’re telling me!

### 0260 Business Trends

Today, I’m going to be giving you a brief overview of the trends that are likely to affect our industry in the next ten years. It’s difficult to predict the fads that affect how the general public thinks and behaves. However, by looking at recent polls, we have a good idea about one area that is likely to have a dramatic influence on the way we do business down the line.

The trend that I’m talking about is the environment. The biggest concern right now across major business industries here and in other parts of the world is about how “going green” will affect company outlook. The growth of environmentally-friendly products has been off the charts in the past five years, and this trend is likely to continue for at least ten more years.

If you’ll look at this chart here, you’ll see what the major trend reports are forecasting. It’s my opinion that it’s time we sat up and took notice.

### 0261 Describing People’s Personalities

Joann: Oh, are those pictures of your kids?

Artem: Yes. These are my three daughters and these are my two sons.

Joann: Your sons look so alike. Are they similar in personality, too?

Artem: It’s funny you ask that. My wife and I are always saying how different they are from one another, even though they’re the closest in age. Sergey, the younger one, is moody and a little timid, while his older brother, Dennis, is talkative and cheerful all the time.

Joann: That’s really interesting. You know, I have an older sister and we’re only a year apart, but we have very different personalities, too. When I was little, I was bad-tempered and I always fought with my brothers and sisters, while my sister was a little angel. She was always patient and generous. I really looked up to her.

Artem: It’s hard for me to believe that you were ever bad-tempered. You’re so even-keeled now. Me, on the other hand, I was a selfish and stubborn kid. I’m surprised that my parents put up with me.

Joann: I’m sure you’re exaggerating. All kids are a little selfish and stubborn, I think. Good thing most of us grow out of it as we get older.

Artem: Well, that may be true, but according to my wife and kids, I’m still the most stubborn person in the world. They may be right.

### 0262 Missing the Tour Group Bus

Kelly: Where is everybody?

Man: Excuse me? Were you talking to me?

Kelly: Oh, no. I was just talking to myself. Our tour group was supposed to rendezvous here at five o’clock for our return trip to the hotel. But there’s no trace of the bus and I don’t see any other people from my group anywhere.

Man: You know, it’s 5:10. Maybe the bus took off already.

Kelly: That can’t be! Our tour guide said that we would meet back here at five-ish. She didn’t say precisely at five.

Man: Maybe that’s what she meant. You know, tour guides usually stick pretty closely to a time schedule.

Kelly: Yes, I know, but what am I supposed to do now? I don’t have any way to get back to the hotel.

Man: Do you have the number of the tour company? I could lend you my cell phone to call them.

Kelly: Let me see. No, I don’t. I feel like such an idiot!

Man: Wait a second. Is that your bus over there?

Kelly: Where? Oh my gosh, I think it is! I must be on the wrong side of the park. If I make a run for it, I may be able to catch it before it takes off. Thanks a lot for spotting it!

Man: No sweat, but you’d better step on it!

### 0263 Getting Older

Angelica: Oh sorry, what was I saying? I lost my train of thought.

Yann: You were telling me about the book you’re reading.

Angelica: Oh, yeah. I must have had one of those senior moments.

Yann: Welcome to the club. That’s what happens when you’re over-the-hill like we are.

Angelica: We’re not over the hill! You may be an old geezer, but I still like to think of myself as middle-aged. Isn’t 70 the new 60?

Yann: That’s what they say, but I don’t mind aging. I may be a little absent-minded now and then, but I’m not senile. What I can’t stand is being treated like I am. The other day, I sat at a table at a restaurant for 20 minutes while the waitress ignored me. She waited on all of the tables around me first, and when she finally came to take my order, she didn’t even apologize.

Angelica: Ageism is everywhere. What I hate is to be talked to like I’m a child. Some people think that if you’ve got gray hair, you’re not all there. I’m as sharp as ever.

Yann: I know, but do you know what we’re doing?

Angelica: What?

Yann: We’re griping. That’s what old people are supposed to do all the time, right?

Angelica: You’ve got a point there. Let’s go do something more productive before anyone notices!

### 0264 Preparing for a Video Conference

Emiliano: I’m not sure about this video conference today. It’s the next best thing to having a meeting face-to-face, but I’ve never used most of this equipment before.

Fatima: It’s a piece of cake. Do you want to do a run-through with me?

Emiliano: Do you mind? I’d really like to make sure that I know how to work this webcam and microphone.

Fatima: I don’t mind at all. Okay, we have Internet connectivity, so streaming won’t be a problem. The speakers on both computers are turned up.

Emiliano: Do you know how to adjust this webcam? Right now, it’s focused on my right ear!

Fatima: That’s easy. Just use these buttons to zoom in or out, and you can tilt up or down.

Emiliano: Oh, I see. That’s better. Now you can see my entire face. Are you getting audio on your side?

Fatima: Yes, you’re coming in loud and clear. I think we’re in business.

Emiliano: Well, that wasn’t so hard. Let’s hope it goes this smoothly this afternoon.

Fatima: If you have a problem, just give me a call.

Emiliano: Thanks. I really appreciate it!

### 0265 Listening to the Radio

Kurt: Turn that radio down!

Gloria: No way! I’m listening to a simulcast of a performance and it’s live.

Kurt: Is it on campus radio?

Gloria: No, it’s on the public radio station. I finally got good reception after putting this long antenna outside my window and I’m not turning it off now.

Kurt: You are so low-tech. I can’t believe you’re still listening to AM/FM radio. You should get satellite radio. You get shows in hundreds of formats, and there are a lot of stations without DJs. And there’s never any static!

Gloria: I like listening to the regular broadcast radio. I don’t have to pay for it and I’m happy with the stations we have in this city. You’re just a technology snob. If it’s high-tech, you love it and have to have it.

Kurt: It’s true that I know quality when I see it, and I don’t settle for less. What’s wrong with that?

Gloria: Nothing, but I don’t have to jump on the bandwagon. Now, be quiet. I’m trying to listen.

Kurt: Fine. This is the thanks I get for trying to give you a little good advice.

Gloria: Shh!

### 0266 Making a Move on Someone

A.J.: What was going on with you and Tiago in his office earlier today? You two were pretty cozy in there.

Gloria: What? Oh, I was a little upset about messing up my presentation in the morning meeting, and Tiago was trying to reassure me about it.

A.J.: It looked like he was doing more than comforting you. He was sitting really close to you and he had his hand on your shoulder. If you ask me, he was making a move on you.

Gloria: Don’t be ridiculous! Tiago and I are just friends.

A.J.: Would you notice if he was? Remember Paul? He hit on you for two weeks before you noticed.

Gloria: That was completely different. He wasn’t hitting on me. He was bothering me, and I actually had to file a sexual harassment complaint against him before he’d stop. You’re comparing apples and oranges.

A.J.: I’m just saying that you’re not the most observant person when it comes to these kinds of things. Mark my words. Tiago is interested in you.

Gloria: If he is, I’m flattered. He’s a very attractive guy.

A.J.: That’s what all the women say. Some guys have all the luck. To add insult to injury, he doesn’t even know that women find him attractive. Even the other men in the office think he’s a nice guy.

Gloria: What can I say? Tell me the truth. Do you really think he’s interested in me?

### 0267 Getting a Traffic Ticket

I was driving down the street when I saw a police car behind me. Suddenly, it turned on its siren. I realized that I was being pulled over.

Officer: Can I see your driver’s license, registration, and proof of insurance?

Ray: Sure. Here you are, officer.

Officer: Did you know that you were speeding? You were going 70 in a 55 mile an hour zone.

Ray: I was? No, I didn’t know.

Officer: You also ran a red light and your brake light is out. I see that your tags have also expired. I’m going to have to cite you for all of that.

Ray: I’m sure I didn’t run a red light, and I didn’t know my brake light wasn’t working. I just renewed my registration and I’m still waiting for my new tags to arrive in the mail. Is there any way I can get away with just a warning?

Officer: I’m afraid not.

Ray: What’s the fine for all of those violations?

Officer: That information is on the back of the citation. Here you are. Have a nice day.

Ray: Thanks. Thanks a lot!

### 0268 Get-Rich-Quick Schemes

Bill: What are you watching?

Susan: I’m watching a really interesting TV program. It’s about how to make a lot of money quickly and easily.

Bill: Are you watching an infomercial? Those things are scams! You should know better than to fall for some get-rich-quick scheme.

Susan: This isn’t a scam. This program is about how make money with no capital. All I have to do is to get other people to sell these products and I’ll get a cut of the profits.

Bill: That sounds like a pyramid scheme. Only a few people at the top make money, while all of the other people lose their shirts.

Susan: It doesn’t seem like a fraud to me. Sit down and watch for a minute and you’ll see all of the testimonials from people who have used this system and who have struck it rich. It may really work.

Bill: There’s a sucker born every minute. How much do you have to pay to learn the secrets to this system?

Susan: It’s only $179.95, and I can pay in monthly installments. The program comes with a step-by-step book and video on how to get started.

Bill: I think you’re wasting your time. I can think of a lot of things I’d rather spend $179.95 on.

Susan: That’s your prerogative. Don’t come to me later when I’m a millionaire and you want my business advice.

Bill: Don’t worry. That will never happen.

### 0269 Health Insurance Plans

At my company, I have a choice of health insurance plans. We can pick between HMOs and PPOs, and I have been with the same managed health plan for the past few years. It’s the plan that has the lowest co-pays and the best coverage, and the network of doctors is fairly large. The drug coverage is good and the affiliated hospital is close to my house. Unfortunately, I’m discovering that it’s also the plan with the largest bureaucracy and patients can easily get lost in the shuffle.

I have a primary care physician, but like other plans, if I want to see a specialist, I must be referred by my primary care physician. I've been trying to see an eye specialist for a few weeks. I called my doctor’s office for a referral, but the nurse told me that I needed to first make an office visit. I tried to get an appointment, but there weren’t any openings for five weeks! I tried to leave a phone message for my doctor to talk to her about my situation, but she never returned my call. I tried several more times, and still received no response.

I finally decided to file a grievance. I know that I have patient rights, and that if I didn’t feel I was being treated fairly, I could file a complaint. I just hope that filing the grievance will get me a resolution to this problem. I’d like to see an eye specialist before I go blind!

### 0270 Airport Announcements

I was walking through the airport to Gate 11 to catch my flight when I heard this announcement:

“Attention passengers on English Air flight 232 to Boise. The departure gate has been changed. The flight will now be leaving from Gate 26.”

That was my flight! I looked at the flight information monitors, turned around, and walked in the opposite direction. As I was approaching Gate 26, there was another announcement:

“This is an announcement for passengers on flight 232 to Boise. The flight has been delayed due to bad weather conditions. The flight crew has arrived at the gate, but the ground crew is still de-icing the wings of the aircraft. Our new departure time is 10:50 a.m.”

I thought the gate agent was done, but she had another announcement to make:

“I’m afraid that flight 232 is overbooked. We’re looking for passengers who are willing to take a later flight in exchange for a travel voucher worth $300. Any passenger who is interested should see an agent at Gate 26.”

Oh, no, I thought. I hope I don’t get bumped from this flight. Fortunately, a few minutes later, I heard this. It was music to my ears.

“We are now ready for boarding.”

### 0271 Using an ATM

I went to bank this morning. Instead of standing in line to talk to a bank teller, I decided to use an ATM, but it wasn’t working.

Robin: Excuse me. Could you help me? I’m trying to use this ATM machine, but it stopped working after I put in my PIN and it won’t give me back my ATM card.

Bank clerk: It looks like the machine is jammed. Step over to this teller window and I can help you. What transactions are you trying to make?

Robin: I want to make a deposit, transfer some money between my checking and savings accounts, and make a cash withdrawal.

Bank clerk: I can make those transactions for you.

Robin: Okay. Let me take this check out of the deposit envelope. And what about my card?

Bank clerk: I’ll call the technician and she should be able to retrieve it for you.

Robin: Thanks a lot. I guess that the machine just doesn’t like me.

Bank clerk: It’s not you. Those machines just act up sometimes.

Robin: In that case, I won’t take it personally.

### 0272 Time Management

Ruby: I’m snowed under with work! I can’t seem to keep up with everything I have to do. You’re always so organized and efficient. How do you do it?

Ian: I’m not always organized and efficient, but I’ve gotten better since I read a book about time management. I use a few tools that the book recommends, which help me to plan and to keep track of deadlines.

Ruby: Do you think it would help me?

Ian: Definitely. This is what I do. I keep a to-do list of all of the things I need to do. Then, I decide which tasks are high-priority and which have low-priority. I write down the deadline I’m given for the task or I assign a deadline of my own, and I make a note of the most urgent tasks.

Ruby: That seems pretty simple, but how do I keep track of the progress I make on a task? Sometimes things just slip through the cracks for me.

Ian: I do a couple of things. First, I keep my list updated. I check off or cross off those that I’ve done. I also put reminders for myself on my computer to help me with scheduling. It helps me to remember my appointments and to allocate my time better.

Ruby: That sounds like a great system. All I need now is some extra time so I can start doing some time management!

### 0273 Telling Secrets to Parents

Therese: I can’t believe you told Mom and Dad about me driving the car last Saturday when I wasn’t supposed to. I thought we had a deal. You wouldn’t tell on me and I’d take you and Kathy to the movies this weekend. You’re such a tattletale.

Stephen: I swear it wasn’t me! Why would I tell? We do have a deal and I’ve held up my end.

Therese: Forget it. The deal is off. There’ll be no movie this weekend.

Stephen: Hey, I told you it wasn’t me who spilled the beans. Are you sure it wasn’t Jeffrey?

Therese: Don’t try to put the blame on somebody else. I know it was you.

Stephen: How?

Therese: You’re a terrible liar.

Stephen: Well, if I did tell on you, I didn’t mean to do it. Come on, please! I really want to see that movie this weekend. What can I do?

Therese: Hmmm...that’s a good question. How about doing my chores for two weeks?

Stephen: Two weeks?! No way. How about one week?

Therese: You’ve got a deal. I’ll take you if you do all of my chores for a week. But I’m warning you. You’re on notice. If you tell on me one more time, you’ll be dead to me.

Stephen: Yeah, yeah. I heard you.

### 0274 Buying Stamps at the Post Office

Clerk: Can I help you?

Tamika: I’d like to buy some stamps.

Clerk: In what denomination?

Tamika: I’m not sure. I need them for sending regular letters and for Priority Mail.

Clerk: The current rate for sending a first-class letter is 41 cents. With first-class service, your letter will get there in three to seven days for domestic mail.

Tamika: For the first-class stamps, how many come in a book or a roll?

Clerk: There are 20 in a book and 100 in a roll. To send a Priority Mail envelope, you can get $4.05 stamps, and delivery is usually in two to three days. How many would you like of each?

Tamika: I’ll take one book of the stamps and four Priority Mail stamps. Can I buy stamps to send an Express Mail envelope, too?

Clerk: You can. Those are $14.40 each.

Tamika: Could you add one of those, too? And how much is it to send a postcard? I don’t need any stamps for those today, but I’m just curious.

Clerk: It’s 24 cents to send a postcard. Okay, that’s a book of 41-cent stamps, four Priority Mail stamps, and one Express Mail stamp. Anything else?

Tamika: Could I pick the design of the first-class stamps?

Clerk: Yes. You can choose from these commemorative ones or the standard flag design.

Tamika: I’ll take the commemorative ones.

Clerk: Your total comes to $38.80.

Tamika: Here’s $40.

Clerk: Here’s your change and your stamps. Have a nice day.

Tamika: Thanks. You, too.

### 0275 A Soccer Match

Shandy: Oh, that player just hit my boyfriend! Did you see that? That was definitely a penalty.

Giuseppe: No, I didn’t. I was watching the goalie. The referee isn’t doing anything.

Shandy: I can’t believe it. Why isn’t the coach talking to that referee? I’m sure the other player deliberately kicked Fabio with his cleats.

Giuseppe: Hey, look! Fabio has the ball and he’s taking it all the way down the field. He shoots, he scores! That’s his second goal of the game. He’s going to win the game for the team.

Shandy: What’s he doing now? Why is he on the ground? Is he hurt?

Giuseppe: I don’t know. The trainer is helping him off the field. It doesn’t look serious.

Shandy: That’s good, but he hates sitting on the bench. He won’t want to watch the rest of the match from the sidelines.

Giuseppe: Look at the stands over there!

Shandy: What’s happening? Why are they all standing up? Oh, they’re starting a wave. I thought for a minute that the fans were getting into a brawl.

Giuseppe: It’s coming this way.

Shandy: Okay, here we go!

### 0276 The Stock Market

Heather: What’s the matter? You look terrible.

Paul: Haven’t you seen the paper? The stock market went down a lot yesterday. The NASDAQ is down 100 points and the Dow is down 30! My portfolio is in big trouble.

Heather: I knew you had some stock options in this company, but I didn’t know you were so heavily invested in the market.

Paul: I’m invested in the bond market, in derivatives, and I have shares in a lot of companies that took a nosedive yesterday.

Heather: I’m sure you have a good stockbroker who has made sure that your portfolio is diversified and you have different kinds of securities.

Paul: That’s my problem. I don’t have a stockbroker. I decided to invest on my own and to go for less secure stocks hoping for a better return. I thought I could tell the difference between a bear and a bull market as well as the brokers. I guess I was wrong.

Heather: The drop in stock prices won’t last. I’m sure the market will rebound. Just don’t panic and sell everything. The old saying, “buy low, sell high,” is still a good idea, I think.

Paul: I know, I know. I won’t do anything stupid – that is, I won’t do anything even more stupid. I’ll wait to see what happens before taking any action.

Heather: That’s a good idea. Come on. I’ll buy you lunch.

Paul: Thanks. Now that I’m poor, I won’t say “no” to your charity.

### 0277 Garage Sales

One of the things I like to do on the weekends is go to garage sales. I’m a bargain hunter and collector, so garage sales are good places for me. I look in the newspapers or just follow homemade signs to find the sales in my neighborhood. Whether it’s because people are doing spring cleaning or getting ready to move, there are always plenty of sales in my area.

After going to a lot of garage sales, I’ve learned a few things about getting what I want at the price I want. Bargaining on price is par for the course at any garage sale. If you don’t want to get ripped off, you’ll try to get the sellers to lower their price. I’m an early bird and I usually get to the sales before other people to get the best items. But to get the best prices, be sure to go back right before the sale ends. Most people are desperate to sell so that they don’t have to store those things again or to lug them to a charity office to give them away. That’s when people are ready to slash their prices. It’s true that there is a lot of junk and knickknacks at garage sales. But one person’s trash is another person’s treasure!

### 0278 Meeting the Future In-laws

Atsushi: I don’t mind telling you that I’m really nervous about meeting your parents.

Scarlet: You look like you’re about to face the firing squad. It’s not going to be that bad.

Atsushi: I wish I could believe that. I’m going to try to make a good first impression, but I don’t think they’re going to like the fact that I’m a professional musician.

Scarlet: I’ve already told them about you, so there won’t be any surprises.

Atsushi: It doesn’t help that your last boyfriend was a straight-laced college student. Couldn’t you have dated a convict before me? I’d look pretty good to your parents in comparison.

Scarlet: How do you know I didn’t? You don’t know everything about me.

Atsushi: Very funny. Maybe we should postpone this visit with your parents for a little while.

Scarlet: No!

Atsushi: I’m just putting it out there.

Scarlet: We’ve put off this visit for months and my parents are really starting to wonder if you really exist. Let’s not blow this visit out of proportion. They’re only my parents.

Atsushi: I know, but they may also be my in-laws soon.

Scarlet: I know, but it’s not like our whole relationship is riding on this visit. I’ll still like you no matter what. And plus, my parents know that I have good taste in men.

Atsushi: At least I know that’s true!

### 0279 Saying Goodbye

Mina: I’d better be going. See you later.

Oliver: It might be awhile before we run into each other again.

Mina: Why is that?

Oliver: I’m going to Puerto Rico for three months starting next Tuesday. I got a job there for the summer.

Mina: I didn’t know that. That’s great! I’ve never been to Puerto Rico, but I’ve heard it’s nice. Have a good trip. It’s a shame we didn’t have more time to catch up. Is your girlfriend going with you?

Oliver: Yeah, she is. She got a job there, too, so we won’t have to be apart for three months.

Mina: That’s good. It’s too bad I won’t get to see her before you two leave. Give her my best.

Oliver: I will. Oh, I’d better get going or I’ll be late.

Mina: It was good seeing you.

Oliver: You, too. Stay in touch.

Mina: I will. Let’s get together when you get back from Puerto Rico.

Oliver: I’d like that. Bye.

Mina: Bye.

### 0280 Viral Marketing

Jayna: I have an idea for creating buzz about our new product.

Maksym: What is it?

Jayna: I think we should use viral marketing. We can spread information about the product quickly and among the most likely customers.

Maksym: I really don’t understand it. How would we do viral marketing?

Jayna: Well, the key is to get plugged into a few people who have large social networks already, such as bloggers and other people with popular websites. We get them talking about the product on their websites and people who visit those websites will tell their friends about it, and they will in turn tell their friends, and so on. If we use these existing social networks, news about our product will spread very quickly.

Maksym: What about the cost?

Jayna: That’s just it. It’s very low-cost because it works through word of mouth.

Maksym: That sounds promising. Why don’t you put together a short presentation about it to present at the department meeting on Friday?

Jayna: Great. I’ll get working on it right away. I think it’s going to transform the way we reach our customers.

Maksym: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let’s see how it goes over with the rest of the department on Friday.

Jayna: Sure thing.

### 0281 All-Inclusive Vacations

Mei: Let’s go on an all-inclusive vacation to a resort in Jamaica!

Guy: I’d like to go to Jamaica, but I don’t know about going to an all-inclusive resort.

Mei: It saves so much time in planning. With these vacation packages, all of our lodging is included and we don’t have to pay extra for anything. For one fixed price, we get unlimited food and drinks, and all of the activities and entertainment we want.

Guy: It sounds a little too predictable to me. You know that when I travel, I like to go off the beaten track. The fun is in going out of the tourist areas to find the real character of a place.

Mei: I know, but a resort has its pluses. If we pick a good resort, we’ll know that everything will be first rate. There won’t be any problems with substandard amenities or service.

Guy: That may all be true, but I’m still not convinced. I’d rather keep looking until we find a good compromise that will have the predictability you want and the spontaneity that I want.

Mei: Okay, but we agree on Jamaica, right?

Guy: Yeah, that’s right. It’s Jamaica or bust!

### 0282 Offending Someone

I was telling my friend, Gina, a joke. I began it by saying, “An Irishman, an Englishman, and a Frenchman walk into this bar, and…” Suddenly, Gina grabbed my arm and shook her head. I turned around and our coworker, Colin, was standing right behind me.

Eileen: Oh, hi Colin. I didn’t see you standing there.

Colin: I guess you didn’t.

Eileen: I was just telling Gina a joke...

Colin: Yes, I know. I heard. I can’t believe you’re telling off-color jokes, especially at work.

Eileen: I’m really sorry. Please don’t be offended. I didn’t intend to insult you. I know that you’re from Ireland. It was just a joke.

Colin: It may be just a joke to you, but it’s getting a little old to me. I already have a tough time fitting in as an outsider in this company, and I’m really tired of being the butt of jokes around here. Besides, ethnic jokes reinforce stereotypes.

Eileen: Please don’t be angry.

Colin: I’m trying not to be oversensitive. I enjoy a good joke as much as anyone, but this isn’t the first time this has happened. The other day, someone drew a picture of me dressed as a leprechaun and put it in the break room. That wasn’t funny, and neither is this.

Eileen: You’re right. We’re all being a little insensitive. As far as I’m concerned, it won’t happen again.

Colin: I accept your apology and I’ll take you at your word.

Eileen: Can we shake and be friends again?

Colin: Yeah, sure. I guess so.

### 0283 A Restaurant Drive-Thru

I had a little time between appointments and stopped at a fast food restaurant to get some lunch. The idea was to save time by using the drive-thru, but it didn’t work out that way.

Order-taker: Welcome to McDenny’s. May I take your order?

Daniel: Yes. I’d like a cheeseburger, an order of French fries, and a large soda.

Order-taker: I’m sorry, sir. Can you speak up and speak directly into the microphone? I can barely hear you.

Daniel: Oh, okay. I want to order one cheeseburger, one order of fries, and a large soda.

Order-taker: That’s four hamburgers, an order of French fries, and a sundae. Would you like anything else?

Daniel: No, I mean, yes. That order isn’t right. I wanted one cheeseburger, one order of fries, and a soda.

Order-taker: No problem, sir. There’s no need to shout. I can add those to your order. That’s four hamburgers, one cheeseburger, two orders of French fries, a sundae, and a soda. Your total comes to $18.95. Please pull up to the next window.

Daniel: Wait! Hello, hello. There’s been a mix-up. Hello!

Order-taker: Please pull up to the next window, sir. There are cars behind you and you’re holding up the line.

Daniel: But you don’t understand. My order is all wrong. I don’t want five burgers!

Order-taker: Well, sir, if you’ve changed your mind, just tell me your new order. There are other customers waiting.

Daniel: Forget it. Cancel my order. I’ve lost my appetite!

### 0284 A Friendly Rivalry

Veronica: I’m finishing up for the day. Do you want to walk out together?

Bogdan: Yeah, that would be great, if you don’t mind waiting until I’ve finished sending this email. I’m letting Tom know that I got another account. That makes four new customers this week.

Veronica: Congratulations, but isn’t that rubbing Tom’s nose in it?

Bogdan: Don’t worry about Tom. He’s been getting new clients left and right. For the past six months, he’s been gloating about his big commissions. I’m just turning the tables, that’s all.

Veronica: Tom doesn’t seem like the type to be smug about his successes.

Bogdan: He doesn’t flaunt it, but he lets people know in subtle ways. Don’t worry. I’m going to put him in his place.

Veronica: This is just too much testosterone for me. Why don’t you guys just go outside, duke it out, and get it over with.

Bogdan: What would be the fun in that? This is just a little friendly rivalry. Nobody takes it seriously.

Veronica: If you say so. I know not to get in the way when there are big egos involved.

Bogdan: You just don’t understand guys.

Veronica: You got that right.

### 0285 A Movie Collection

Some people collect stamps. Other people collect CDs. I collect movies.

I’m a film buff and I have a collection of my favorite movies of all time. I usually buy a movie when it comes out on DVD, even if I’ve seen it already on the big screen. I have a high definition TV and I like watching movies in the comfort of my own home.

I prefer the widescreen editions and the DVDs with a lot of bonus features. I pride myself on finding every Easter egg on every DVD I own. My friends think I’m crazy. Even if I already own a movie, I’ll buy it again if there’s a special edition or box set with extra bloopers or deleted scenes.

Even when I’m on vacation, I look for DVDs. Last year, I was traveling abroad and I bought some DVDs. When I got home, though, I found out that I couldn’t play them in my DVD player because they had a different region code than the one we use in the U.S. I also bought a bootleg DVD on the street and the quality was terrible. I really learned my lesson on that trip!

### 0286 Describing Facial Features

I was mugged while I was walking home last night. This morning, I was at the police station with a sketch artist to see if we could come up with a picture of what the thief looked like.

Sketch artist: Okay, you said that this was a man in his 40s. Can you tell me what shape his face was: thin, round, oval, or square?

Anna: His face was long and thin, I think.

Sketch artist: Were his eyes more round, bulging, or squinty?

Anna: Well, I think they were round, but not too round, and he had bushy eyebrows. He also had a pointed nose, not a hooked one.

Sketch artist: Take at look at this so far. Is this right?

Anna: His nose in the sketch is a little too turned up. It was more straight.

Sketch artist: What about his ears? Were they big or small? And his mouth? Did he have thin or thick lips?

Anna: His ears were average size and they didn’t stick out too much. His lips were more thin than thick.

Sketch artist: We’re almost done. What about his hair? Did he have long or short hair?

Anna: Oh, didn’t I tell you? He’s bald.

Sketch artist: Okay, then. I’m done. What do you think? Is this the guy?

Anna: Wow, you’ve done a great job. Yeah, that’s him. That’s the guy who stole my wallet.

Sketch artist: You know, he looks familiar. I have a feeling I’ve seen him before.

Anna: I hope so. Maybe you can help find him.

Sketch artist: Yeah, now if only I could remember where I’ve seen him before...

### 0287 A Traffic Jam

I was on my way to a restaurant to meet my date for dinner when I hit a traffic jam. I saw that the road was congested, but since I had to take the bridge to reach downtown, I had no choice but to stay on that road.

The traffic was bumper-to-bumper. One crazy driver even tried to drive on the shoulder to get around the backup. But as it turns out, there wasn’t any way to bypass it because the backup wasn’t due to an accident, a stalled car or some rubberneckers. It was because of road construction and only one lane was open.

After 25 minutes of stop-and-go traffic, I was at my wit’s end. My date was sitting at the restaurant waiting for me and I didn’t have her cell phone number. What’s more, I was really hungry.

Finally, I got past the road construction and was on my way again. I drove a little recklessly, but I had to make up for lost time. I really liked this girl. The last thing I wanted was to make her think that I stood her up!

### 0288 A Business Contract

Violet: Thanks for agreeing to meet with me about the new contract. It’s important that both parties understand and agree to all of the terms before we can move ahead.

Karik: It’s in the best interest of both of our companies for this agreement to be signed, so I’m glad to be here. How should we proceed?

Violet: You and I have both read the contract, but I think it’s useful to go over the main articles to make sure there aren’t any clauses that are objectionable. If you’ll take a look at Article One...

.......

Karik: This looks in order. The stipulations we asked for are all there. Now if we can move to Article Six, I have a question about the conditions for declaring the contract null and void.

Violet: I’m glad you brought that up. I know that this was a sticking point during the negotiations and I believe we’ve found an acceptable compromise.

Karik: I’m sure you have. Let’s take a look.

### 0289 Communication Problems

Ethel: Can we talk?

Fred: Uh-huh.

Ethel: I don’t think we communicate very well. We don’t talk to each other like we used to. I think we need to have a dialogue about these dysfunctional communication patterns.

Fred: Hmm.

Ethel: I think we need to work on our relationship. We have a strong foundation, but we have problems relating to each other. Oprah says...

Fred: Hold on! Is this something you saw on the Oprah show?

Ethel: Well, yes, it is. Oprah did a show about how couples grow apart after years of being together, and good communication is the cornerstone of a good relationship. Being a sympathetic listener and validating each other’s feelings are very important.

Fred: Stop right there. I’ll make you a deal. I’ll communicate more with you, but you have to promise not to bring up Oprah again. I don’t want a talk show host telling me how to run my life.

Ethel: She’s more than a talk show host. She’s...

Fred: I mean it. I’m putting my foot down. No more Oprah. Okay?

Ethel: Okay, if that’s how you feel about it.

Fred: It is.

Ethel: That’s fine, but I wonder what Dr. Phil would say about your hostile feelings toward Oprah.

Fred: Uh!

### 0290 Riding the Subway

Misha: I’d like to buy a token for the subway.

Clerk: The subway doesn’t use tokens anymore.

Misha: Oh? I didn’t know that. It’s been a few years since I visited New York. How do I pay for the fare?

Clerk: You can buy a ticket for a single ride that expires two hours after it’s issued. If you’re going to be here all week, I’d suggest getting a seven-day card that gives you unlimited rides. Otherwise, I’d recommend getting a MetroCard.

Misha: I’m only here for two days. How much is each ride?

Clerk: It’s $2.00. If you buy a MetroCard worth more than $10.00, you get a 20% discount. So with a $10.00 card, you get six rides instead of five. The card allows you to transfer to buses, too.

Misha: Okay. I’ll take a MetroCard worth $10.00. How is the money deducted from my card?

Clerk: The turnstile automatically deducts the fare each time you go through it. Here’s your card.

Misha: Thanks, but I’m not sure which line to take to Queens.

Clerk: Here’s a subway map. Follow the signs to the platform of the train you want.

Misha: Okay, thanks.

### 0291 Going on a Diet

Decima: My scale at home can’t be right. I weighed myself this morning and I’ve gained another five pounds since last month!

Sebastian: You’re not the only one. My pants are feeling tight and it’s getting harder to see my feet!

Decima: Okay, I’m making a decision right here, right now. I’m going on a diet, and I’m going to do whatever it takes to shed these extra pounds. Right after work I’m going to the drugstore for some diet pills.

Sebastian: You’ll want to take it easy with those pills. My wife took some diet pills last year and she did lose some weight, but she gained it right back. She found it was better to eat right by getting plenty of fruits and vegetables, and to eat more low-fat protein and fewer empty carbs. The truth is, she had been yo-yo dieting for years until she changed her diet and started exercising.

Decima: Oh, no. Not exercise. I hate exercising. I’d rather fast than go to a gym.

Sebastian: That’s how I feel, but I’m starting to come around to my wife’s thinking. Working out helped her with her 30-pound weight-loss earlier this year and she’s kept it off. I may follow her example so I can get rid of these love handles.

Decima: What kind of exercise are you thinking about?

Sebastian: Nothing too strenuous. I’m thinking of walking before work everyday and maybe taking a walk at lunchtime.

Decima: I suppose I could start with some walking. Maybe I’ll join you for your lunchtime walk. If I don’t do something soon, I’ll be obese in a few months.

Sebastian: No, you won’t, but you’re welcome to join me. When should we start? Today?

Decima: Today? No, not today. Let’s start tomorrow.

Sebastian: All right. We’ll start tomorrow, then.

### 0292 Business Insurance

Carson: What happened here?!

Samantha: As you can see, there was an accident. Early this morning, a man driving along this street lost control of his car and ran into the front window of our store. Luckily, no one was hurt.

Carson: What are we going to do? We can’t open for business with this mess. There’s glass everywhere!

Samantha: I think the first thing to do is to call the insurance company. We have full coverage, so I’m sure we’re insured against accidents of this kind. As long as our policy hasn’t lapsed and we’ve paid our annual premiums, I don’t think we need to worry too much.

Carson: Not worry too much? But what if this is considered an act of God and we’re not covered?

Samantha: Believe me, this will be covered. When we call the insurance company, I’m sure they’ll tell you that.

Carson: Okay, but we can’t open for business. We have to get an adjuster out here and it’ll take days – maybe weeks – for our claim to be paid.

Samantha: That’s why we have business interruption insurance. Don’t you remember we added that to the store’s policy last year after you were in the hospital for three weeks? We got it to guard against the store having to close temporarily and the business losing money. Let’s get the ball rolling by calling the insurance company.

Carson: I forgot about the business interruption insurance. Thank goodness you’re here. What would I do without you?

Samantha: Just remember that the next time I ask for a raise.

Carson: A raise? Oh, right. Come on. Let’s not sit here talking all day. We need to call the insurance company.

### 0293 Being Affectionate in Public

Nelly: Look at that couple over there. What they’re doing is indecent!

Sadat: Where? Oh, you mean those two people hugging and kissing? That’s not indecent.

Nelly: They’re not just hugging and kissing. That girl is sitting on her boyfriend’s lap and they’re making out in the middle of a public place. They need to get a room.

Sadat: They’re just passionate, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Don’t you remember when you were a teenager in love?

Nelly: When I was a teenager, we behaved a lot more modestly. We might hold hands or give each other a peck on the cheek in public. That’s it. Anything else we did, we did in private.

Sadat: Oh, you’re not saying that you didn’t get cozy with your boyfriend as a teenager, you’re just saying you did it in private.

Nelly: Right. What I object to is having to watch other people’s public displays of affection. It turns my stomach.

Sadat: Don’t look now, but there’s another PDA over there.

Nelly: Oh, no!

### 0294 Living in a Condo or Co-op

Diane: I’m so exasperated! I’m really tired of the homeowner’s association in my condo building.

Ricardo: What’s the matter with it?

Diane: The people who sit on the condo association board are a bunch of do-nothings. I’ve filed complaint after complaint and they refuse to enforce the house rules.

Ricardo: Well, that might not be so bad. I used to live in a co-op in New York City. The board of directors in my building was constantly issuing violations to the shareholders and we were fined for the smallest infraction. It was a nightmare. What kinds of complaints have you been filing?

Diane: I’ve been complaining about my noisy neighbors. They have parties every weekend. The board said it sent letters to them, but nothing has changed.

Ricardo: That’s a tough one. It’s often hard to get people to quiet down.

Diane: That’s not all. The common areas aren’t well maintained, and they’re often dirty or in need of repair.

Ricardo: That’s too bad...

Diane: And, the clubhouse is always busy with board events when I want to reserve it.

Ricardo: That’s frustrating...

Diane: You bet it is. And, what’s more...

Ricardo: Whoa. I think I have a solution for you.

Diane: What?

Ricardo: Move!

### 0295 Playing Video Games

Achim: Check out this new game I just got!

Marcia: Let me see. Oh, it’s a fighting game. I’m not into those. I like role-playing or simulation games a lot better.

Achim: This isn’t just a fighting game. You have to use strategy for each mission. Check out these amazing graphics!

Marcia: I can’t play that at my house. I have a different console.

Achim: Yes, you can. It’s multiplatform. Look at the box. It says that you can use a joystick as your navigation system or a keyboard and mouse.

Marcia: You know, right now I’m really into retro games.

Achim: You mean last year’s games?

Marcia: No, I mean really old school games, like the ones my parents used to play.

Achim: You mean like Pac-Man and Pong?!

Marcia: Yeah, exactly. They’re classic and a lot less violent.

Achim: Yeah, but they’re so boring you fall asleep playing them. You can’t call yourself a gamer if you play those kinds of games. Give me 3-D action and some blood and gore.

Marcia: You can have it. I’ll pass.

### 0296 Bad Manners at a Business Lunch

Yolanda: I will never invite George to another business lunch with clients again!

Sunan: Why, what happened?

Yolanda: George has the worst manners of anyone I know. First of all, he was ten minutes late. And as soon as he sat down, his cell phone rang and he answered it!

Sunan: Maybe it was an important call?

Yolanda: From his girlfriend? It was completely unprofessional.

Sunan: I know George is a little rough around the edges, but he’s not that bad.

Yolanda: You don’t think so? After I introduced him to the clients, he told them that he had been up late the previous night, because one of our other account representatives didn’t finish her proposal and he had to complete it. Everyone knows not to air their company’s dirty laundry in public, especially in front of clients.

Sunan: Okay, that was a blunder. Normally, George isn’t so clueless. I wonder if he was distracted.

Yolanda: I don’t buy that as an excuse. And here’s the kicker: He ordered two drinks during lunch! If that weren’t bad enough, when he ordered his second one, he jokingly thanked the clients for paying for lunch. Of course our company was picking up the tab since we invited them! I was mortified.

Sunan: I’ll admit that that was bad, very bad. Are you going to have a talk with George?

Yolanda: I will as soon as I calm down a little. I’m seeing red right now.

Sunan: Then waiting a little while is a good idea. I’d better go warn George...

### 0297 Being Rich and Poor

Lynn: I’ve been trying to help Monica find an apartment, but it’s impossible to find anything affordable on this side of town and near her work. The only thing that’s within her budget would require a 50-minute commute each way!

Santiago: I know. It’s become really ridiculous. I’m reading an article about how the income gap between the rich and the poor in this country is getting wider and wider. Poverty is the worst it’s ever been in cities like L.A., while you see affluence everywhere.

Lynn: I know I poor-mouth sometimes, but at least I can afford the basic necessities.

Santiago: Yeah, I do the same thing. I feel like such a hypocrite sometimes. The other day, I was feeling sorry for myself because I couldn’t afford the fancy new car I wanted. My old car isn’t that old! I’ve only had it for five years and it still works, most of the time. I forget about people who don’t have a car and are living on food stamps.

Lynn: Me, too. Looking for an apartment with Monica has really put things into perspective for me. The next time I complain about not having enough money for a pair of new shoes or to take a vacation, remind me of the great inequities of this world, will you?

Santiago: Sure, only if you’ll do the same for me when I try to tell you that I really need that flat-screen TV.

### 0298 Visiting a Museum

I wanted to visit the National Museum, but when I arrived, it was closed.

Rudy: Can you tell me the hours of operation for the Museum?

Guard: It’s open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday. It’s closed on Sunday.

Rudy: Thanks. I’ll be back tomorrow.

---------

The next day, I arrived at the Museum at 10 a.m. and the same guard was there.

Rudy: Hello, again. Can you tell me if the Museum has any tours?

Guard: The Museum has a self-guided tour. You can get information at the ticket window.

Rudy: Oh, thanks. Do you know if I can use my flash to take photos in the Museum?

Guard: You can take pictures, but flash photography is prohibited. Food and drinks are prohibited, too.

Rudy: Oh, I guess I need to get rid of this bottle of juice before I go in. Do you know if all of the exhibits are open to the public today?

Guard: The east wing is under construction, but the rest of the galleries are open. The sculpture and painting galleries are to your left, and the artifacts are to your right.

Rudy: Thanks a lot. How much is the admission charge?

Guard: It’s $10.00 for adults, $3.00 for children, and $5.00 for seniors and students with picture ID. The people at the ticket window can help you with that.

Rudy: Thanks. Just one more question.

Guard: Yes?

Rudy: If I leave after I pay, can I come back in?

Guard: Yes. You just have to show your stub. Anything else?

Rudy: Oh, no. Thanks a lot. Sorry to have bothered you.

Guard: No trouble at all.

### 0299 An Old Love

Juan: You’ll never guess who I got an email from yesterday.

Naomi: Who?

Juan: Diana Shultz.

Naomi: Weren’t you two an item back in high school? So, you got an email from an old flame. Very interesting.

Juan: Well, that’s ancient history. We lost touch after we went off to college.

Naomi: What did she say in her email?

Juan: She said she was going to be in town next month and wanted to know if I wanted to get together for dinner.

Naomi: Are you going to go?

Juan: I don’t know. Her email came out of the blue.

Naomi: Aren’t you dying of curiosity? I know I would be. Maybe she still has feelings for you.

Juan: Stop it! It’s just dinner, and I’m sure she just wants to catch up on old times, nothing more.

Naomi: I wouldn’t be so sure. You’ll go, right?

Juan: I might as well. If I make an excuse, she might think I’m trying to avoid her.

Naomi: Good. Go and then tell me all about it afterwards. You know I have no social life, so I live vicariously through you.

Juan: Stop making things up. You date more than anyone I know. Okay, I’m going, so stop pestering me.

Naomi: All right, but I can’t wait to hear all about it!

### 0300 Arriving for an Appointment

I arrived a little early for my sales appointment with the office manager of Lyon Industries, and spoke to the receptionist.

Juri: Hello. I’m here for my 11:30 appointment with Sue Gibbons.

Receptionist: What is your name?

Juri: It’s Juri Lakoff.

Receptionist: I’ll let her know that you’re here. [Speaking into the telephone] Sue, this is Rhonda. Your 11:30 appointment is here. Should I send him up? Okay, I’ll do that. [Hangs up the telephone] Ms. Gibbons says that she’s running a little late and is tied up in another meeting right now. She should be wrapping things up very quickly and will be free in a few minutes. Would you like to wait in the reception area right over there?

Juri: Sure. No problem.

Receptionist: Can I get you something? Coffee or tea?

Juri: No, I’m fine. I was just wondering how many employees you have in this office.

Receptionist: I don’t know precisely, but I think we have about 80.

Juri: Oh, that’s a lot. Is the company planning on expanding?

Receptionist: I’m sorry, but I really don’t know. I’m sure Ms. Gibbons can answer those questions for you.

Juri: Right, right. I didn’t mean to pump you for information. I was just trying to get the inside scoop on the company before my meeting.

Receptionist: I understand. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to answer this call. Ms. Gibbons should be finished with her other meeting in no time.

Juri: Oh, sure. I didn’t mean to keep you. Sorry.

### 0301 Buying a Men’s Suit

Sales clerk: Good afternoon. What can I help you find?

Bo: I’m looking for a suit for work.

Sales clerk: I’m sure we have something for you. Are you looking for a traditional or contemporary suit?

Bo: I’m not sure. I’d like to try on some different ones.

Sales clerk: That’s no problem. Let me show you a few over here. This is a two-button pinstripe suit that’s made of 100% wool and has a flat front. What do you think?

Bo: It looks nice. How about this one?

Sales clerk: Oh, this is a very fine suit. As you can see, it’s double-breasted and is fully lined. The pants are pleated. Would you like to try it on?

Bo: Sure.

Sales clerk: Just follow me to the dressing rooms in the back. Here you are. My name is Caroline. Just let me know if you need anything.

Bo [comes out of the dressing room wearing one of the suits]: I like this single-breasted one. I like the side vents. All of these suits need to be dry cleaned, is that right? I travel a lot in my job and I worry about my suits getting dirty on the road.

Sales clerk: Yes, they all need to be dry cleaned, but since both of these suits are a dark color, that shouldn’t be too big of a problem. How does that feel?

Bo: It’s a good fit and it’s very comfortable. Okay. I’ll take this one.

Sales clerk: Certainly. I’ll ring you up. Do you need anything else? A vest, suspenders, or a garment bag to store the suit?

Bo: No, thanks. I’ll just take the suit.

Sales clerk: No problem. Just follow me.

### 0302 A Problem with a Restaurant Check

I waved my hand to get the waiter’s attention.

Waiter: Yes?

Leslie: The check, please.

Waiter: Would you like any dessert, or some tea or coffee?

Leslie: No, just the check. Thanks.

Waiter: Here you are. I’ll ring that up for you when you’re ready.

Leslie: Thank you. Oh, there seems to be a mistake on our bill. We didn’t order this appetizer.

Waiter: Let me check this and I’ll be right back...Here you are. I’ve adjusted the check. I took off the appetizer.

Leslie: Thanks, but there still seems to be a problem. We had a two-for-one coupon, but we’ve been charged for both meals.

Waiter: I’m sorry, but you needed to present the coupon to me when you placed your order, not when you’ve finished your meal.

Leslie: That isn’t stated on the coupon. I don’t want to be a pain, but could I see the manager, please?

Waiter: I’ll see if she’s available...I talked to the manager and she said to make an exception in this case and to give you the discount.

Leslie: Okay, thanks.

### 0303 A Traditional Wedding

I arrived at my friend Karin’s wedding a little late and the ceremony had already begun. I’ve been to a lot of civil ceremonies, but it had been a while since I had attended a religious one. They had asked a minister to officiate.

When I arrived, Karin and her fiancé, Jan, were standing in front of the church.

Minister: We are gathered here today to join Jan and Karin in holy matrimony. If there is anyone here who knows of a reason why these two should not be joined in marriage, speak now or forever hold your peace.

Fortunately, no one said anything.

Minister: Jan and Karin, please face each other and join hands.

Minister: [To Jan] Do you, Jan Casanova, take Karin Valentine, to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, for better and for worse, for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, ‘till death do you part.

Jan said, “I do,” and the minister asked Karin the same question, and she said, “I do,” as well.

Minister: May I have the rings? [To Jan] Please place this ring, a symbol of your love, on Karin’s hand and say, “With this ring, I thee wed.”

Jan put the ring on the fourth finger of Karin’s left hand. Karin said the same thing and put a ring on Jan’s finger.

Minister: I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride.

Jan and Karin kissed and we all applauded.

Minister: Ladies and gentleman, it is my great honor to present to you for the very first time the happy couple, Jan and Karin.

### 0304 A Potential Partnership Meeting

Flavio: Thanks for meeting with me.

Marcia: It’s my pleasure. We’re eager to hear your ideas about our companies doing business together in the future.

Flavio: Well, I wanted us to meet because I think our two companies can create great synergy.

Marcia: I agree. What do you have in mind?

Flavio: We seem to have core capabilities that complement each other, and I want to see how we can create a partnership that would be to our mutual benefit.

Marcia: Yes, that’s why I’m here. I think we’re thinking along the same lines.

Flavio: Good. I’m glad to hear that. If we can pull off a partnership, we could really dominate the market.

Marcia: Yes, I think that’s true, too, but let’s get beyond the preliminaries. What kind of business model do you have in mind?

Flavio: Well, that’s why I wanted to meet with you. I’d like to get your perspective on that.

Marcia: I see. When your company approached us about working together, we were under the impression that you had some concrete ideas to present.

Flavio: Oh, we do. I just wanted to get your suggestions before we present a formal proposal.

Marcia: Let’s do this. Why don’t you send me a proposal in writing and I’ll make sure that we give it our full consideration.

Flavio: We’ll do that. Thanks for your time.

Marcia: Don’t mention it.

### 0305 Describing People’s Body Types

Remi: We need to get these costumes sorted out. I’m not sure we have ones that will fit each person in this play.

Bryan: Let’s see. We need a shirt for Hector. He’s broad-shouldered, so this one would be too small. Any luck finding one over there?

Remi: No, but I think I found a dress for Lee Ann. She’s petite and thin, and I hadn’t been able to find anything that would fit someone that slender. All of the other dresses are for women with either pear-shaped or hourglass figures.

Bryan: Okay, at least that’s some progress. What about Malcolm? Unlike his brother who is tall and skinny, he’s big and fat. How are we going to find one to fit him?

Remi: He’s not fat! He’s stocky. He is really muscular and not at all flabby. Oh, here’s a pair of pants that would fit Pierre. These are perfect, since he’s not long-legged like all of the other men.

Bryan: We’re actually doing pretty well, I think.

Remi: We just need a costume for you.

Bryan: Me?! What do you mean? I’m not in this play.

Remi: Oh yes, you are. Ike dropped out, so they need a replacement and you’re the only one who isn’t already in the play.

Bryan: Oh, no. I thought I could avoid being in the play by volunteering to help with the costumes!

Remi: Sorry, but I don’t think you can get out of it this time.

### 0306 Giving First Aid

Jeng: What did you do this summer?

Cynthia: I worked at a summer camp as a nurse’s aide. I thought we would be giving simple first aid, but you wouldn’t believe the kinds of injuries the kids came in with.

Jeng: You mean like poison ivy, bee stings, bug bites, and scraped knees?

Cynthia: Yeah, we had those, but we also had some pretty serious cases. For instance, the second day of the camp, one of the boys who didn’t know how to swim fell into the lake. He must have hit his head because he was unconscious when they brought him in. We couldn’t find his pulse and the nurse did CPR. Luckily, we got him breathing again right away, but that little boy had a concussion.

Jeng: Wow! You’re kidding. That’s serious.

Cynthia: That wasn’t all. It’s true that most of the kids came in with superficial scrapes, but some of them had some major wounds. We had to stop the bleeding and bandage them up. We had one girl who needed 12 stitches after she fell out of a tree.

Jeng: Geez, I never knew going to camp could be so hazardous to your health!

### 0307 Cable and Satellite TV

Marion: I’m trying to decide whether to get cable or satellite TV. Which one do you have at your apartment?

Cesar: I have satellite, but I used to have cable.

Marion: What’s the difference?

Cesar: Not a lot. With satellite, you have to have a satellite dish installed on the roof and you don’t with cable. Otherwise, you get similar options. You can get basic channels and choose from a lot of different premium channels. I have a package that includes the basic channels and some premium movie channels, and I also have a sports package so I can watch all of the soccer matches I want.

Marion: How much is the monthly fee?

Cesar: I think I pay $59.99 a month, excluding the taxes and fees, but the basic service is probably cheaper. When I had cable, I had to pay a deposit for the cable box, but with satellite, I had to buy the dish outright, but it wasn’t too expensive.

Marion: What I want are pay-per-view channels, so I don’t need to run to the video rental store every time I want to watch a movie.

Cesar: That’s not a problem. There’s video on demand on both cable and satellite, and there are a lot of movies to choose from.

Marion: That’s great. I’ll check out whether my local cable company or satellite service has better packages and make a decision this weekend.

Cesar: You could always start with the basic channels and then add services as you go along.

Marion: That’s a good idea, especially since I know someone who has premium channels and round-the-clock soccer.

Cesar: You bet. Drop by anytime, but don’t forget the beer and popcorn!

### 0308 Formatting a Document

Franz: I’ve just switched over to this program and I can’t figure out how to format my document. Can you help me?

Helen: I can try. Let’s take a look. What do you want to do?

Franz: I want to change the margins so I can fit more on a page. I don’t know how to change the default settings. I also want to put this section on a separate page.

Helen: Okay, you can adjust the margins by moving this up and down, and from side to side. If you want this section on a separate page, just add a page break.

Franz: Oh, I see. What if I want to add a header or a footer?

Helen: You go to this pull-down menu and select the header and footer option. Then, you can type in the text you want. If you want to add a page number, just insert one by selecting it from this menu.

Franz: That seems easy. What if I want to change the font?

Helen: You can change the font style or size by selecting the text and then making the change on the toolbar. See?

Franz: Yeah, that seems simple enough. I also want to change the orientation of the page. How do I do that?

Helen: Right now your document is portrait. To make it landscape, you just go to the “Page Setup” and change it.

Franz: That all seems pretty easy. I think I’ve got it.

Helen: Good. Give it a try. If you get stuck, I can try to help.

Franz: Okay, great! Now, can you go over again how to change the margins, insert a page number, change the page orientation, and add a footer?

### 0309 Describing Distances and Giving Directions

Daniella: Could you tell where I can find a drugstore?

Hotel clerk: Sure. There’s one up the street near the corner of Selma and Main. If you get to Abreu Avenue, you’ve gone too far. It’s set back from the street so it’s a little hard to find.

Daniella: Oh, that’s okay. I’ll keep an eye out for it.

Hotel clerk: You know, I just remembered that there’s a bigger and better drugstore around the block. It’s no more than a three-minute walk. Go out the main doors of the hotel, hang a left, go straight for about a quarter of a mile, and then make another left at the first street.

Daniella: Okay. I think I’ve got that. Thanks.

Hotel clerk: Now, if you want a drugstore with a pharmacy, you’ll need to walk a little farther. Go out these doors, walk roughly three blocks until you get to a dead end, turn right, cross the street, and you’ll see a bank. It’s kitty-corner from the bank. You should be able to walk there in five minutes, give or take.

Daniella: Thanks. Thanks a lot. I think I’m all set. See you later.

Hotel clerk: You know, I just remembered that there’s another drugstore...

Daniella: Thanks, but I’ve really got to get going. Bye.

Hotel clerk: Well, some people just don’t appreciate other people’s help!

### 0310 Shopping for Furniture

Tobias: I really don’t understand why we need new furniture. After we’re married, we’ll just take the things from each of our two apartments and that should do the trick.

Renee: We each have some things we can keep and use, but it would be nice to have pieces that match. Right now, we have six dining chairs, each in a different style, and none of them are in the same style as the dining table your uncle is giving us as a wedding present.

Tobias: Yeah, that’s true. At least, we won’t have to shop for bedroom furniture. We’re lucky that your parents are giving us some hand-me-down things, including a dresser, two nightstands, a headboard, and a wardrobe. All we need is a bed.

Renee: Yeah, we got lucky when they decided to get new furniture and to give us their old pieces. That just leaves the living room.

Tobias: But we already have a couch and a love seat.

Renee: That’s true, but we still need a coffee table, two side tables, and at least two table lamps and a floor lamp.

Tobias: Do we really need all of that?

Renee: If we plan to entertain, we do.

Tobias: All right. I was just hoping to get home in time for the game this afternoon.

Renee: No problem. We only have six more stores to visit after this one.

Tobias: Six?!

Renee: Yes, now come on. How are you going to get home in time for the game if you don’t hurry up?

### 0311 A Mid-life Crisis

Bella: I think my husband is going through a mid-life crisis.

Russell: What makes you think that?

Bella: He just traded in his car for a very expensive sports car, and he’s filling the house with gym equipment.

Russell: Uh oh, that’s a bad sign. Do you know what may have triggered this?

Bella: I’m not sure, but he was passed over for a promotion at work a couple of months ago, and his new boss is 15 years younger than he is.

Russell: That would do it.

Bella: What really worries me is that he’s been talking about quitting his job altogether and becoming a full-time writer. He always wanted to become a successful writer.

Russell: That’s sounds familiar. When my brother went through a mid-life crisis, he spent a lot of time reflecting on his life and regretting giving up music to get a full-time job. He saw himself as being washed up and he was fed up with everything.

Bella: What did he do?

Russell: Well, he’s probably not a good example of what your husband would do.

Bella: Don’t beat around the bush. Just tell me.

Russell: Well, if you must know, he got a divorce, married a woman half his age, and tried to start a rock band.

Bella: Oh, no! That’s just what I was afraid of.

Russell: I’m sure that won’t happen with your husband. You two have a great marriage.

Bella: I thought so, too, but you never know.

### 0312 Different Work Styles

Before I started my new job, I didn’t know that I would be working so closely with another employee of the company. I was used to a lot of autonomy in my last job, and I have always been self-directed. I didn’t need close supervision and the boss never had to worry about me slacking off. To tell the truth, I was a little apprehensive about working in a team after having had so much independence. To my surprise, though, I liked the collaborative environment and I think I actually do better work because of it.

Of the two of us, Delilah is the creative one. While I’m a little adverse to risk, Delilah is always challenging the status quo. She often has good ideas, and because I’m pretty resourceful, we often find a way to put those ideas to work. Delilah has great follow-through, too, and I never need to worry that things will fall through the cracks.

I think the key to our success in working together is that neither one of us tries to exercise authority over the other. We respect each other’s abilities and we know when to take charge and when to back off. If you had told me a year ago that I would be working in a team environment and enjoying it, I would have told you that you were crazy. But I guess the old saying isn’t true: You can teach an old dog new tricks.

### 0313 A Suspicious Neighbor

Patricia: What do you think of our new neighbor?

Ray: I don’t know. I haven’t met him yet.

Patricia: Me neither, but I think he’s a shady character.

Ray: Why do you think that?

Patricia: Well, when he was moving in, I tried to shoot the breeze with him and he was shifty. When I asked him what line of work he was in, he was very evasive.

Ray: Maybe he just didn’t want to talk to a busybody when he was busy moving boxes. Have you thought of that?

Patricia: I wasn’t being a busybody. I was just being neighborly. When I offered to help him, he practically kicked me out of his apartment.

Ray: Okay, you must be right. He’s probably a serial killer.

Patricia: I wouldn’t put it past him.

Ray: Come on. My guess is that he just wants some peace and quiet.

Patricia: He wants peace and quiet to do what? That’s what I want to know.

Ray: I think we should just mind our own business.

Patricia: You can do what you like, but I’m going over there and I’m getting some answers. If I have live next to him, I’m entitled to know something about him.

Ray: Why don’t you leave the man alone? He’s entitled to some privacy. And plus, he probably won’t let you in.

Patricia: That’s what you think. I’m not taking no for an answer.

Ray: That poor man!

### 0314 Buying a Digital Audio (MP3) Player

Clerk: Can I help you?

Sandy: I’m looking for an MP3 player, but I don’t know a lot about them.

Clerk: We have a large selection, as you can see.

Sandy: Wow, I really don’t know where to begin.

Clerk: What do you want to be able to do?

Sandy: I just want something small and portable that I can use to listen to music that I rip from CDs. I also want to be able to download songs off the Internet.

Clerk: Most of the players you see here can do that. One thing you have to watch out for is that some music websites are proprietary. That means that you can only listen using certain types of players.

Sandy: That’s what I’m worried about.

Clerk: Well, this one plays music in a lot of different file formats and is compatible with most of the major music download sites, both proprietary and open-source. It comes with an FM tuner, a built-in battery charger, and good quality headphones.

Sandy: What about it’s storage capacity and charge time?

Clerk: It has 30 gigabytes of memory and can hold about 7,500 songs. You get about 15 hours of music playback on one charge and it charges up in about four hours. It has a nice screen, too, that’s backlit.

Sandy: It looks like what I’ve been looking for. I’ll take it.

### 0315 Going to the Park

I arrived at the park a little early for our neighborhood baseball game and I needed to kill some time. I decided to take a walk along one of the trails so I could look at the scenery. Suddenly, I came across a woman sitting under a tree.

Octavi: What a beautiful day to be at the park!

Irene: Oh, hi. Yes, it’s a nice day, isn’t it?

Octavi: You look comfortable sitting on the grass in the shade reading.

Irene: It’s a quiet spot away from the playground.

Octavi: Do you come here often?

Irene: Not too often. I come here every so often on the weekends.

Octavi: This is a great spot for a picnic. I saw a lot of people on the other side near the fountain, but this is much more peaceful.

Irene: Yeah, that’s why I like it here. Were you looking for the baseball field? It’s on the other side of the park.

Octavi: Yes, I know. I was just warming up with a little walk around the park. We have a baseball game starting in a half hour.

Irene: I saw some people practicing when I walked past the field earlier. I haven’t seen a baseball game in ages.

Octavi: Why don’t you come and watch? It should be a good game.

Irene: Maybe I will. Thanks for the invitation.

Octavi: No problem. Take care.

Irene: You, too.

### 0316 Business Emails and Abbreviations

Dear Sam,

I am writing to follow up on our phone conversation re: the upcoming meeting. We’ve made good headway in our planning, having settled many of the arrangements, e.g., the date, time, and venue. However, we still need to decide on the agenda, i.e., who will speak, in what order, and for what length of time. Fortunately, we have free rein to set up the meeting as we see fit, so it’s just a matter of hammering out the details before we can invite the participants, book the meeting room, etc.

I suggest that we call a second meeting and invite some of the people who will be involved in the meeting: Adam, Lin, Toshi, Cecelia, et al. With everyone there, we should be able to come to a decision about the remaining issues. If this is in line with your thinking, I’ll send out an email ASAP.

Let me know what you think.

Luis

P.S. We also need to start planning the annual meeting, but we can wait until this one is wrapped up before we start on that.

### 0317 Setting the Table

William: This is a very special dinner. It’s not everyday that I have my bosses over for dinner. It has to be perfect.

Martha: I know. Why do you think I took out our best china? Instead of worrying, why don’t you help me set the table?

William: Right. I should make myself useful. Is this the best tablecloth we have?

Martha: Yes, it is. It’s very fine linen.

William: Oh, right, right. Okay, we need six table settings. That means we need dinner plates, salad plates, bread plates, coffee cups, and saucers. Where are the saucers?

Martha: All of the dinnerware is over there. Be careful!

William: I know, I know. Where’s the silverware? We’re missing the silverware!

Martha: No, we’re not. All of the silverware is in this drawer. Put the dinner and salad forks on the left and the dessert fork above the plate, like this. The tines should be facing up. The knife and spoon go on the right.

William: I know that. I was just looking for the steak knives.

Martha: We don’t need those tonight. Here, take these wine glasses and put them on the table.

William: What else? What else?

Martha: Nothing. You need to take a deep breath and calm down, or you’ll be in bad shape by the time the dinner starts.

William: It’s too late. I’m already a ball of nerves!

### 0318 Writing a Love Song

Isaac: Can you keep it down in there? I’m trying to write a song.

Brittany: You are? What kind of song?

Isaac: It’s none of your business.

Brittany: Come on. Tell me.

Isaac: It’s for Melanie.

Brittany: Oh, it’s a love song. That’s so romantic. Are you going to serenade her?

Isaac: Maybe. Now leave me alone so I can write.

Brittany: Don’t kick me out. Maybe I can help. Let me hear what you have so far.

Isaac: Oh, all right. Here are the lyrics. There’re pretty rough. Can you think of something that rhymes with flower?

Brittany: Hmm...let me see. They’re not bad, not too sappy. Let’s hear the melody...That’s nice. The chorus is catchy. Are you going to sing it a cappella?

Isaac: I was going to ask Jimmy to play the guitar to accompany me, so I can make a recording of it.

Brittany: Let me do it. I can play the guitar.

Isaac: No way. You won’t take it seriously.

Brittany: I will. I promise. I’ll make little kissing noises in the background and it’ll move her to tears.

Isaac: Forget it! What was I thinking telling you about it?!

### 0319 Being Under Stress

Wei: What’s wrong? You look like you’re in pain.

Jason: My stomach is acting up again.

Wei: It’s all of this stress. I don’t know how anyone can cope with the pressures you’re under.

Jason: It’s nothing. I’ll just take a pill for my stomach.

Wei: That won’t solve the problem. Look at you. You look worn out. Are you losing sleep, too?

Jason: I have had trouble sleeping.

Wei: It’s no wonder. At home, you have the demands of raising two kids on your own, and at work, you’re in a dog-eat-dog environment everyday.

Jason: I have to admit that my nerves are shot, but what can I do?

Wei: Maybe we can work something out. To start, how about if I watch your kids for a few hours this weekend so you can get some rest?

Jason: I couldn’t ask you to do that. You have to take care of your own kids.

Wei: So, what’s two more?

Jason: If you really don’t mind, I’ll take you up on that. I could really use a breather.

Wei: It’s set, then. Here, take one of these pills. If it doesn’t kill you, it’ll make you stronger.

Jason: Thanks!

### 0320 Micromanaging the Staff

Barry: Where are you going?

Jane: I’m checking up on Rudy. I gave him a task an hour ago and I want to make sure he’s doing it right.

Barry: You’re not micromanaging again, are you?

Jane: Of course not. I’m only going to observe his work and make sure that he’s following the detailed instructions I gave him.

Barry: That sounds like micromanaging. If you’re always looking over their shoulders, how are you ever going to develop trust with your employees?

Jane: My employees will earn my trust by being meticulous with their work. Good employees don’t mind me monitoring their progress.

Barry: That may be true, but I heard Rudy and Jena talking and they said they’re feeling a little resentful that you don’t have more faith in their ability. They feel like you’re treating them as though they’re incompetent.

Jane: I am not. You’re making me sound like a control freak.

Barry: I just call them like I see them. Micromanaging is a bad tactic and I can see why your employees are disgruntled.

Jane: I resent that. I have a very good working relationship with my employees.

Barry: I’m sure you do. I was just trying to help. I’m really not trying to butt in.

Jane: Fine. You manage your staff the way you think best and I’ll manage mine.

Barry: Fine by me.

### 0321 Buying a Jacket or Coat

Michael: Mom, I don’t need a new coat. I like my old trench coat. It’s comfortable, and I can use it as a raincoat and an overcoat. So what do I need a new coat for?

Lisa: If you’re going to visit your aunt in Maine, you’ll need something warmer than a trench coat. This parka is nice.

Michael: I’m not wearing a parka. If I’m not warm enough, I’ll wear my denim jacket under my trench coat.

Lisa: That’s ridiculous. You can’t wear a jacket and a coat each time you go outside. Look, this down coat will keep you nice and warm. It has a high collar, a hood, and thick cuffs, and it’s very roomy so you’ll be very comfortable in it.

Michael: It’s too long. I don’t need a knee-length coat.

Lisa: Yes, you do. You’ve never been in really cold weather and when you get there, you’ll be thankful to have something so warm. Now, we also need to buy you a blazer.

Michael: A blazer? What for?

Lisa: Your aunt is probably going to take you to some nice places and I don’t want you to look like a bum. See? This one is nice and fitted.

Michael: It’s trimmed with flowers!

Lisa: Those aren’t flowers. They’re paisleys. You’ll look very nice in it.

Michael: Please, Mom, don’t make me wear that. I’m begging you.

Lisa: You’ll look like a nice young man in this coat and blazer.

Michael: I’ll be the laughing stock of the entire State of Maine.

Lisa: No you won’t. Now, we need to buy you some new underwear.

Michael: Mom! Shhh! Not so loud. This is so embarrassing!

### 0322 Picking up a Rental Car

Ralph: I have a reservation for a car.

Clerk: What is the last name on the reservation?

Ralph: It’s Furcal.

Clerk: Just one moment. I have a reservation for Ralph Furcal, picking up today and returning on the 19th.

Ralph: Yes, that’s right. I reserved an economy car.

Clerk: We do have an economy car reserved for you, but for $3.00 more per day, you can upgrade to a mid-sized car. And, for only $5.00 more per day, you can upgrade to a convertible. Would you like to take advantage of either of these offers?

Ralph: No, thanks. I’ll stick to the economy car.

Clerk: That’s fine. If you’ll just sign here and initial here, here, and here, please. Would you like to purchase insurance for the car?

Ralph: No, thanks.

Clerk: Okay, then just sign here to decline the insurance. Be sure to return the car with a full gas tank or you’ll be charged $3.00 per gallon. Remember also that you are not allowed additional drivers unless they are over the age of 25.

Ralph: Okay, I’ll do that.

Clerk: Here is your contract. Your car is in parking space number W34. Just show your paperwork to the employee at the gate as you exit the parking lot. Do you need a local map?

Ralph: Yes, I’d like one. Thanks.

Clerk: Here you are. Have a good stay in our city.

Ralph: Thanks. I appreciate it.

### 0323 Rooms in a House

I don’t like cats. That’s not really true. I like cats, but they don’t like me.

Last week, my friend Sara asked me to babysit her cat for two days while she was out of town. Normally, I would have said no, but she was in a jam, so I said okay.

As I said, cats don’t like me. When I got home from work, I couldn’t find her. I was sure she was hiding from me. I looked all over the house.

I started with the bedrooms, looking in the closets and under the bed. I looked in the bathroom and even behind the shower curtain. I went downstairs and searched the basement. No cat. Next, I looked all over the living room, checking under the couch and behind the TV. I also looked in the pantry and then the laundry room, thinking that the cat must be hiding behind the washer or dryer. Still, no cat.

Finally, I looked in the kitchen. There was the cat. She was sitting on the counter. Somehow she had managed to open a box of cookies and there she sat eating them all. When the cat saw me, she started mewing. I don’t speak the language of cats, but I could have sworn that she was asking me for some milk!

### 0324 Corporate Sponsorship

Travis: I don’t know how we’re going to keep our free sports program going without more funding. As it is, we’re strapped and I don’t know how we’re going to continue.

Megumi: I know you’ve been resistant in the past, but what about corporate sponsorship? I’m sure we can find some businesses that want to support us.

Travis: I know you’re trying to help, but I’m not willing to sell out.

Megumi: It’s not selling out to have sponsors. Some businesses really want to keep public programs like ours free and available to the public. Being a benefactor is their way of helping us do that. In exchange, those companies get more exposure and enhance their public image. It’s a win-win for everyone.

Travis: Don’t get me wrong. I’m not trying to get on a high horse about sponsorship, but I don’t want product placement, business signage, and outright advertising at our games. It sends the wrong message to the kids in the program.

Megumi: I don’t think it’s an all-or-nothing idea. You can limit the kinds of sponsorship you accept. Just don’t throw out the baby with the bath water. You know, it may be our only option.

Travis: Okay, okay. I’ll look into it. You may be right. If it’s a choice between canceling our programs and getting sponsorship, then I may have to live with it.

Megumi: Good. Let’s keep an open mind and I’m sure we’ll find something that will work.

### 0325 Describing People’s Moods

Brett: Do you know what kind of mood Mom is in?

Molly: Not really. Why?

Brett: I really need a raise in my allowance and I’m waiting for the right time to ask. She’ll be more likely to say “yes” if she’s not feeling too grouchy.

Molly: I wouldn’t count on this being a good time. She looked a little upset after getting off the phone with Aunt Teri.

Brett: Why?

Molly: Aunt Teri has been down in the dumps since Cousin Frank decided to take a job in Cambodia. He’s on cloud nine about this new job, but Aunt Teri is anxious about him moving so far away.

Brett: I see. Well, I’ve got to think of some way to cheer her up. It’s a lost cause if I ask her while she’s angry, on edge, or depressed.

Molly: You know that Mom is always happy to hear good news about school. Do you have anything new to report?

Brett: I hadn’t thought of that. I need to come up with something.

Molly: Be patient. Wait for the right moment and then strike. I speak from years of experience.

Brett: Right. Thanks.

### 0326 Finding the Right Wine

Antonio: Why are we stopping here?

Melanie: We can’t go to the dinner party empty-handed. We need to bring a bottle of wine.

Antonio: I don’t know anything about wines. You’ll need to pick a bottle.

Melanie: I don’t know much about wines, either. I just know we need a good table wine. Do you think we should get a bottle of white, red, or rosé?

Antonio: I don’t know.

Melanie: The label on this one says that it’s fruity and not too tart. This other one says that it’s full-bodied, but I think we want a light-bodied one, right?

Antonio: I have no idea.

Melanie: The label on this one says that it’s from a California vineyard. Is that good or bad?

Antonio: I don’t know. Stop asking me. Here’s a corkscrew. Why don’t you take out the cork and we’ll have a taste?

Melanie: That’s very funny. You’re not helping me at all.

Antonio: I say we just bring them a six-pack. I know I’d rather have beer than wine any day.

Melanie: Stop fooling around. We need to pick out a bottle of wine.

Antonio: I have an idea. Let’s bring them a bottle of champagne. You can’t go wrong with champagne.

Melanie: Champagne? It’s not a special occasion.

Antonio: We’ll tell them that being invited for dinner in their home is a special occasion for us. They’ll be happy to hear that.

Melanie: I don’t know about that.

Antonio: Trust me. Grab a bottle and let’s go. We’re late!

### 0327 Getting Caught in the Rain

Margo: Oh geez, you’re drenched! It wasn’t supposed to rain today.

Ali: I know. I looked at the weather report last night and it was supposed to be a nice day. That’s the last time I trust those weathercasters! I hate getting caught in the rain. I’m soaking wet.

Margo: When I felt a raindrop on my head this morning, I should have known that we were in for a big rainstorm. Right then, I should have gone back into my house to get an umbrella, but as usual, I was running late.

Ali: I can’t believe I have to go out on sales calls today. I’m not looking forward to getting back in my car when it’s raining cats and dogs out there.

Margo: Somebody in this office must have an umbrella you can borrow for the day. I’ll go see.

Ali: Thanks. It looks like it’s only drizzling now. Maybe it’s letting up.

Margo: Don’t count on it. It’ll be pouring again in a minute. Let me see if I can round up an umbrella and maybe even a raincoat.

Ali: Thanks. I’ll be in the bathroom wringing out my clothes. What a miserable day!

### 0328 Dishonesty at Work

Amina: Have you heard the latest news?

Shane: No, what is it?

Amina: Charlie was fired last Friday after the company found out that he had been cooking the books for over six months and had embezzled more than $50,000.

Shane: Charlie? I don’t believe it! He is the most upstanding person I know. I can imagine him stretching the truth now and then, but he’s the last person I would think of as being truly dishonest. I would never think to question his integrity.

Amina: It wasn’t greed that made him do it. His wife has been ill and he couldn’t pay the medical bills. I think he had the best of intentions in trying to get his wife the healthcare she needed, but it was only a matter of time before he got caught, no matter how well he covered his tracks.

Shane: Well, I know he’s a bad liar and he’s not known to make mistakes, so I’m not surprised that someone caught on pretty quickly when there were irregularities in the accounting. What I don’t understand is, if he was having financial problems, why didn’t he tell anybody? Some of us may have helped.

Amina: I don’t know. Maybe he felt desperate and just didn’t know what to do. I’m sure his wife being sick has been difficult for him. I don’t think the company is going to press charges, though, under the circumstances.

Shane: I’m glad to hear that. That’s the last thing he needs. It’s clear that he showed poor judgment, but he’s not a criminal.

Amina: That’s the general consensus. I’m thinking of taking up a collection to help him out. Do you think the company would mind?

Shane: Considering he was fired, I’d keep it a secret from management, but I think it’s a great idea.

### 0329 Being Persuasive

Sylvia: How would you like to take my sister, Donna, to the movies this weekend? You’d be doing me a favor.

Joon: Why? What’s wrong with her?

Sylvia: Nothing is wrong with her! She just broke up with her boyfriend of four years and she’s down in the dumps. She’s shy, so I thought I’d try to set her up on a date.

Joon: Off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen things I’d rather do than to take out anyone’s little sister, including yours, no offense.

Sylvia: You don’t know what you’re missing. She may be shy, but she’s very pretty and witty. If you met her, you wouldn’t need me to persuade you.

Joon: I don’t know. I’m not convinced. Whenever someone sets me up on a blind date, they always tell me how great the woman is. She never lives up to the hype.

Sylvia: I’m not going to twist your arm, but if you’re on the fence, I have two free movie tickets to that new movie you want to see, just to sweeten the pot.

Joon: You do? Well, why didn’t you say so earlier?

Sylvia: I’m glad I could tempt you. Here’s her number. I’ll tell her to expect your call. Be nice.

Joon: I’m always nice. Don’t worry. I’ll show her a good time.

Sylvia: Not too good!

### 0330 Traveling by Bus

(telephone ring)

Samantha: Good morning. I had a few questions about buying a bus ticket. Do I need to buy one in advance?

Agent: You can, but it’s not necessary. You just need to arrive at the terminal at least an hour before the scheduled departure time to buy your ticket. Boarding begins about 15 to 30 minutes before departure.

Samantha: Can I reserve a seat?

Agent: No, seating is on a first-come, first-serve basis. I recommend getting there early during peak times, but getting a good seat isn’t usually a problem with the night service buses.

Samantha: I want to go from Charlestown to Myrtle Beach. Do you know how many stops the bus will be making?

Agent: I think that bus makes six stops to pick up passengers en route, but you can check the schedule to be sure. That doesn’t include rest stops and meal stops. If you want to make fewer stops, you can buy a ticket for one of our express buses.

Samantha: How many bags can I bring on board? I’ll have two big pieces of luggage.

Agent: You’re allowed two bags. The handler can help you load them upon boarding, but you’re responsible for retrieving them when you get off. Can I help you with anything else?

Samantha: No, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling and have a safe trip.

### 0331 Washing Clothes

Mina: What happened here? Is the washing machine not working?

Arlo: What do you mean?

Mina: Why are all of your white T-shirts now pink?

Arlo: That just happens. Sometimes they turn pink, gray, or another color, depending on which clothes I put in a load.

Mina: Didn’t anyone teach you how to do laundry? You’re supposed to separate your whites from your colors and wash them separately.

Arlo: It doesn’t really matter. I don’t mind if they get dyed a different color. As long as they get clean and the stains come out, I don’t really care what color they are.

Mina: I have some bleach that may be able to get your T-shirts white again. I better try before you put them in the dryer.

Arlo: Don’t bother. It really doesn’t matter to me. I’m almost done here. I’m just waiting for one more load to finish.

Mina: What kind of detergent are you using?

Arlo: I ran out of detergent, so I’ve been using dishwashing liquid. It works pretty well.

Mina: No wonder your shirts are as stiff as a board. Good thing you don’t own any delicates or they would be completely ruined. Before you put your clothes in the dryer, clean out this lint filter. It’s really dirty. I don’t suppose you use fabric softener.

Arlo: No, I like to keep things simple and dry my clothes on a clothesline. I don’t mind if they’re a little stiff.

Mina: Remind me never to ask you to do my laundry.

Arlo: Life is too short to worry about laundry.

### 0332 Profit and Loss

Dolores: Manuel in accounting is supposed to help me with this report, but he called in sick today! I can’t believe my luck. He’s supposed to be training me in and he’s left me holding the bag.

Anton: Let me see if I can help.

Dolores: I’m supposed to use the information from this profit and loss statement to make some projections about the company’s future performance for our report, but I’m not sure what I’m doing. I need to plug in some numbers here, but I can’t make heads or tails of this.

Anton: Well, if you look at the top of the statement, you’ll see the top line, which shows the revenue the company brought in in the third quarter of this year. Is that what you need?

Dolores: Yes, I think so, but I also need to know our net income.

Anton: Here is the bottom line. That takes into account all of the revenue and expenses during the third quarter.

Dolores: That’s great, but I also need to know the gross profits and operating expenses.

Anton: Those are in this column. See?

Dolores: I guess all the information is here. I just needed to know where to look. Thanks. I couldn’t have figured it out without you.

Anton: It’s not that complicated. Hopefully, Manuel will be back tomorrow.

Dolores: Manuel? Who needs him!

### 0333 Quitting Smoking

Vera: Hi, I thought you might be out here. Geez, it’s really cold!

Paul: I know, but I really needed a smoke break after that long meeting. Can I bum one off you? I left my pack of cigarettes on my desk.

Vera: Sure. Here’s my lighter. What do you think about the new incentives the company is offering to employees to quit? Have you thought about it?

Paul: Yeah, but I’ve smoked for 20 years. I tried going cold turkey once, but it didn’t work. I’m doomed to a lifetime of ashtrays and stained fingers.

Vera: I’ve been butting heads with my boyfriend for years. He wants me to quit, but I say, to each his own.

Paul: The incentives are pretty good, though, I have to admit: a cash bonus and more money towards our health plans.

Vera: Yeah, I could use the cash. Have you tried one of those nicotine patches?

Paul: No, I haven’t.

Vera: Well...I’ll try it if you will.

Paul: Do you think it would work? I think I’m a lost cause.

Vera: I’m not sure, but if you’ll try them, I will, too.

Paul: Okay, but I’m warning you. I have no willpower.

Vera: All right, but just remember: no pain, no gain.

### 0334 Hiding from the Police

I read an article in the newspaper this morning about a man who had been on the lam for 12 years. He was wanted by the police because they believed he had committed a murder. But before the man could go to trial, he bolted and left the country. He has been on the “Most Wanted” list in this state ever since.

How did he get away? The police had confiscated his passport, but he wore a disguise and became a stowaway on a ship heading for China. While on the boat, he kept out of sight and was holed up in the cargo section of the ship the entire time. No one even had an inkling that he was on the ship! When the ship arrived in China, he got off and immediately assumed a new identity. At first, he didn’t have any identification and he had to go underground, but eventually, he made enough money to buy a passport on the black market.

How did he get caught? He tried to reenter the United States and the security officers at the airport saw that his passport was forged. He was nabbed right away and he’ll be going to trial soon. That is, unless he escapes!

### 0335 Getting a Car Serviced

Sophia: Is my car ready?

Mechanic: I’m finished with your oil change and I replaced the oil filter. I’ve also replaced the wiper blades in your windshield wipers. But I’ve had a good look under your hood, and your car needs a lot of work.

Sophia: Really?

Mechanic: Yes, you have some serious problems. I bet your engine is running really rough. Your transmission is leaking, your shocks need to be replaced, and you need new brake pads. Your battery is very low and it should replaced, too.

Sophia: I can’t believe it.

Mechanic: It’s true. Your tires need to be rotated, too, and I also suggest getting a wheel alignment.

Sophia: Well, this is all a big surprise, especially since I just bought this used car a couple of months ago.

Mechanic: You did? Well, you got ripped off. Whoever sold you this car is a crook. Where did you buy it?

Sophia: I bought it here! I bought this from the owner of this garage. He said that it was in tip-top shape!

### 0336 Going Out of Business

Julianne: I’m really glad to be back in Macville. What happened to the market that used to be here?

Helio: Oh, it went belly up. It struggled for many years. The owners tried to downsize and reduced the space they were renting, but they had to throw in the towel when they got into debt.

Julianne: What a shame! It was such a nice store, and the family who owned it was always so friendly.

Helio: Yeah, things have changed a lot around here.

Julianne: Where is the restaurant that was next to the market? I used to eat lunch there all the time.

Helio: The owners couldn’t make it profitable and after trying to get loans to bail themselves out, they ran out of options. They had to pack it in.

Julianne: What’s happening here?

Helio: The gift shop is going out of business. It’s having a big sale to liquidate the store. The owners lost their lease and have to close. This store has been in the family for generations, but the property owners want to tear down the building for a parking lot.

Julianne: A parking lot? For what? With this economic downturn and all of these businesses going bankrupt, who will want to park here?

Helio: Your guess is as good as mine.

### 0337 Reading Comic Books

Lee: What are you reading?

Stan: It’s a graphic novel.

Lee: Graphic novel? You mean a comic book? I thought you were too old for that sort of thing.

Stan: For your information, this is a graphic novel and it’s a literary art form. Graphic novels are written for mature audiences, not kids.

Lee: Really? I don’t know anything about comic books. I like reading the comic strips in the newspaper, but I’ve never read an entire comic book before.

Stan: You might want to check these out. Look at this bound collection, for instance. It has a storyline that’s as complex as a novel, and each panel is a work of art.

Lee: It is pretty impressive looking. I’m not that interested in superheroes, though.

Stan: The Superman and Spider-man comic books are great, but the graphic novels today are even more sophisticated. Some of them are still serialized like the old comic books, but many of them are self-contained like this one.

Lee: Are there ones without too much fighting?

Stan: There are as many genres of graphic novels as there are movies or books. I’m really surprised that someone who likes to read as much as you do knows so little about graphic novels.

Lee: I’ve come across them in bookstores before, but I had a preconceived notion that they were for kids.

Stan: I guess you were wrong.

Lee: I guess I was. There’s a first time for everything.

### 0338 Refusing an Invitation

June: Did you get an invitation to Kelly’s party?

Roberto: Yes, I did. I’m going to send my regrets. How about you?

June: I’m trying to find an excuse not to attend, without Kelly taking offense.

Roberto: Couldn’t you just tell her that you have another engagement that night?

June: I used that little white lie last time I turned down one of her invitations. I have to think of something else.

Roberto: How about telling her that you have to take care of a sick relative? That one always works for me.

June: I’ve used that one, too. I told her that I was looking after my mother the last time she invited me to dinner.

Roberto: How about if you tell her you’re on a special assignment at work and you have to work night and day to get it done?

June: That’s a little far-fetched, don’t you think? I work as a store clerk.

Roberto: You’ve got a point there.

June: What are you going to tell Kelly when you decline her invitation?

Roberto: I’m going to extend an apology and just say that I can’t make it.

June: That’s it? I’d never thought of just saying “no.”

Roberto: You know the old acronym: KISS – Keep It Simple, Stupid.

June: You’re right. Hey! Who are you calling stupid?

### 0339 Star-crossed Lovers

Romeo: What do you plan to do?

Juliette: I don’t know! I can’t defy my parents. They’ve been against our relationship from the start, and I’ve been forbidden to see you.

Romeo: It’s your life, not theirs. It’s time you stood up to them and told them what you want. I’m tired of being a puppet in the feud between your family and mine.

Juliette: That’s easy to say, but I can’t confront my father and tell him that I want to be with you. It would kill him!

Romeo: No, it won’t. He’s using guilt to get you to give me up. Don’t let him manipulate you that way.

Juliette: This is tearing me apart. I can’t take it much longer.

Romeo: You won’t have to. I’m leaving – without you.

Juliette: No! You can’t. I can’t live without you.

Romeo: Someday, we’ll be together...Cut! Where is the director? This is supposed to be the story about star-crossed lovers, not a trashy melodrama. Whoever wrote this trash should be fired!

### 0340 Office Competition

Okay, everybody. Listen up. We’re approaching the end of the month. Unless you’re new here, you know that we are in competition with our rival, the East Coast office, to have the most sales this period.

At the beginning of the month, we pulled ahead and it looked like we were finally going to turn the tables and defeat the East Coast office. But after the first 10 days of this month, we fell into a tie with them, and as of last Friday, we are still neck and neck.

We’re now coming up to crunch time and the last thing we want is to fall behind when it looks like we may be able to top the East Coast office for the first time in two years. I’m really proud of this office for outdoing itself to get us in a position to win, and there’s no reason we should suffer another loss now.

Okay, everybody, let’s put our noses to the grindstone and pull out this victory!

### 0341 An Annoying Cell Phone User

Carl: I’m sorry, say that again. I couldn’t hear you over that guy at the next table shouting into his cell phone.

Stephanie: That guy is so rude. We’re trying to have a leisurely conversation over a cup of coffee, and we have to out shout some inconsiderate jerk.

Carl: Do you think he realizes what a nuisance he is?

Stephanie: I bet he doesn’t. People don’t seem to have any idea of cell phone etiquette. Cell phones should be banned from restaurants, don’t you think?

Carl: I completely agree. I don’t need to know the intimate details of other people’s lives. I sometimes wish I had a cell phone jammer. Like the other day, I was at the movie theater, and the woman sitting in front of me answers her cell phone and has a conversation during the movie!

Stephanie: I would have kicked up a fuss or at least shushed her.

Carl: I tried to shush her, but she pretended not to hear me. I wish...[Carl’s cell phone rings]...hold on one second. Hello, oh hi, Manny...

Stephanie: [Stephanie’s cell phone rings] Hello, yes, this is Stephanie. Oh hi, Leah. Oh sure. I can talk.

### 0342 At the Butcher’s

Butcher: What can I get for you?

Gina: I’d like a pound of ground beef, please.

Butcher: Would you like the regular or the extra lean? The extra lean is a dollar more per pound.

Gina: I’ll take the regular. Could you also throw in two thick pork chops and two chicken breasts?

Butcher: I’m sorry, but we’re out of chicken breasts right now, but we have some thighs.

Gina: Hmm...In that case, I’ll just take some ham. I’d like that thinly sliced.

Butcher: Okay, is there anything else?

Gina: Yes, I’d like some other cold cuts, but I’m not sure which ones. Why don’t you give me half a pound of salami and a pound of bologna?

Butcher: No problem. Will that be all?

Gina: No, I’d like two steaks. Do you have any that are very, very tender? The ones I bought last week were really tough.

Butcher: We have T-bone, rib eye, and sirloin steaks. The rib eye is probably the most tender.

Gina: I’ll take two of those.

Butcher: Okay, anything else?

Gina: No, I think that’s all...for now.

### 0343 Being Alike and Different

Fabian: Oh, your babies are adorable. They’re like two peas in a pod.

Clarissa: They may look like mirror images of each other, but they’re nothing alike. They each have their distinct personalities. Randy likes to sleep during the day and Dominic likes to sleep at night.

Fabian: That’s like my babies at home. They’re polar opposites. They don’t like eating the same foods and they have clashing personalities.

Clarissa: Oh, really? Does that cause problems?

Fabian: Yes, sometimes it does. One is playful all the time and the other one is always pensive. They get on each other’s nerves more often than not. I can’t believe they have the same parents.

Clarissa: You’re telling me! I sometimes wonder how two babies born at the same time can be so different.

[barking sound] Oh, my precious little babies are hungry. We’d better get home so they can eat.

Fabian: I’d better get home to mine. They’ll be crawling up the walls if I don’t get back soon with their treats!

### 0344 At the Convention Center

I left my hotel early so I would arrive at the convention center in time for my presentation, but the bad traffic made me late. My presentation was supposed to start at 2:00 and it was already 1:55! To make matters worse, I had never been to this convention center before and I didn’t know my way around.

I walked into the foyer and looked around. I was hoping to see a registration booth or the speakers’ room, where I was sure someone could point me in the right direction. I walked down one hallway and found the main ballroom, but it was empty. I saw a sign for meeting rooms upstairs and went up the escalator. But when I got to the second floor, I didn’t see anyone around. I looked over the landing, hoping to get my bearings, but that was no help. By this time, I was sweating bullets. The clock was ticking and I was late!

Then, I woke up. It wasn’t the first time I had a nightmare like this, and I knew it wouldn’t be the last. I wonder what my subconscious is trying to tell me? At least this time, I was wearing my pants!

### 0345 The Seven-year Itch

Sunny: Did you hear the news? Nancy and Brian are splitting up.

Igor: How long have they been married?

Sunny: Eight years. I’m sure it was the seven-year itch. I bet Brian was unfaithful to Nancy.

Igor: How do you know? Maybe it was Nancy who had a wandering eye.

Sunny: Maybe, but it’s a shame. They were such a nice couple. Doesn’t anyone take marriage vows seriously these days? To me, it’s a lifelong commitment.

Igor: If you ask me, I think our notion of marriage is out of date. Conventional wisdom is that everybody wants to be unfaithful after they’ve been married a few years. Why not make marriage a short-term arrangement? In my view, a marriage should last for seven years unless you want to renew. If you don’t, you each go your separate ways.

Sunny: You make marriage sound like an apartment contract! Not everybody is as cynical as you are. I don’t think that most couples think seriously about committing adultery, and many couples stay together for life.

Igor: You may live in la-la land, but I live in the real world.

Sunny: If that’s the real world, I don’t want to live there!

### 0346 Using the Restroom

Denzel: Excuse me, where is the restroom?

Server: It’s down the hall, on your left.

Denzel: Thanks.

When I got into the bathroom, it was a mess. I walked into a stall and there was toilet paper all over the floor. There were no toilet seat covers and the toilet wouldn’t flush. Even the toilet seat was broken!

I gave up on the stall and decided to use a urinal. I went to wash my hands, but there was no soap in the dispenser. I kept hitting the pump, but nothing came out.

When I turned on the faucet, water splashed all over my pants. I looked for some paper towels to dry myself, but they were out. I tried using one of the hand dryers, but that was broken, too.

I couldn’t believe what a mess this bathroom was. I just thought, what happened here? World War III?

### 0347 Writing a Postcard

I was on vacation in Yosemite and I decided to send a postcard to my friend, Elaine, who was on her own vacation in Europe.

Dear Elaine,

I arrived safely two days ago and I’m having the time of my life. I met some nice people here and we’ve been keeping each other company. The weather has been ideal and we’re off on another hike tomorrow. This is the life.

Wish you were here. I hope you’re having as good a time as I am.

See you soon!

Vivian

On the day I sent my postcard to Elaine, I got one from her. She wrote:

Dear Vivian,

I’ve had a nightmare of a trip. Our flight was delayed and we missed our connection to Oslo. I’ve been here three days and it has poured the entire time. There’s nothing to do but sit in the hotel. What a dump! It looks nothing like the pictures and it’s not at all what I expected. I even got food poisoning the first day I was here!

I hope your trip wasn’t a washout like mine. I can’t wait to get home!

Elaine

### 0348 Showing Disapproval and Sympathy

Maggie: Why the long face?

Joe: I just heard that I won’t be rehired for next year.

Maggie: That’s awful! What a rotten thing for the management to do.

Joe: I’ll be okay, but Monica is losing her job, too.

Maggie: Oh no, not Monica, too. I’m so sorry to hear that. Who do they think they are? How can they treat us this way?

Joe: They’re management and they can do whatever they want to. Monica just bought a new house and I’m sure she’s going to have to sell it.

Maggie: That’s really too bad. Listen, I know you’ll be dead set against the rest of us pulling together to talk to the management, but I think the time has come.

Joe: I won’t let you or anyone else around here put your jobs on the line to try to save ours. The management will definitely take a dim view of us workers trying to speak out. Just lay low and hope that you won’t lose your job, too.

Maggie: I don’t know what the others think, but I’m not going to take this lying down. If they think we’re just going to sit here and take it, then they’ve got another thing coming!

### 0349 Taking Vitamins and Supplements

The last time I went to the doctor for a checkup, she told me that I needed to start taking some dietary supplements that had the vitamins and minerals that my body needed to stay healthy. I told her that I ate a balanced diet, but she said that many people who generally ate well still didn’t get the nutrients their bodies needed every day, and that’s why she recommends taking a multivitamin. I remember taking chewable vitamins when I was a kid, but as an adult, I never thought I needed it. It wasn’t because I had any signs of deficiency, she said, but that it was better to be safe than sorry.

I asked if it was possible to overdose on over-the-counter multivitamins, and she said that it was highly unlikely if I followed the recommended dosage. She said that most people’s bodies are able to tolerate and absorb the multivitamins without any problems. As I get older, she said, it’s all the more important to take care of myself.

She’s right, of course. I shouldn’t neglect my health. I just wonder if I can find some of those chewable vitamins in the shape of my favorite cartoon characters. I may be an adult, but I don’t always have to act like one!

### 0350 A Movie Review

Sally: Did you see the new movie, The McQuillan Story? I’m writing a movie review for the school paper.

Marcus: I went to the premiere last week. What did you think of it?

Sally: I liked it. I thought it was entertaining, although it wasn’t groundbreaking, by any means.

Marcus: You thought it was entertaining? I thought it was awful. I almost walked out. The acting was wooden and uninspired, and the direction was amateur.

Sally: Aren’t you being too critical? It was the director’s first movie and I thought his directorial debut wasn’t bad. If there was a problem, it was with the screenplay.

Marcus: Don’t get me started on the screenplay! The story was so predictable and the dialogue was pretentious. This movie is going to bomb for sure.

Sally: Oh, I don’t know. I think some people may enjoy it.

Marcus: If you want to do your readers a favor, you’d tell them to skip this movie and save their money!

### 0351 Asking for a First Date

Natalie: Hello.

Sergio: Hi, could I speak to Natalie?

Natalie: This is she.

Sergio: Oh hi, this is Sergio. How are you?

Natalie: Good. How about you?

Sergio: I’m great. Uh, well, the reason I’m calling is I was wondering if you’d like to go out sometime?

Natalie: You mean on a date?

Sergio: Yeah, with me.

Natalie: I’d love to.

Sergio: Really? I mean, that’s great. I was thinking we could grab dinner on Friday and then see a movie. How does that sound?

Natalie: Oh, I already have plans for Friday.

Sergio: How about Saturday?

Natalie: I’m tied up on Saturday, too. I’m free tomorrow, though. I don’t suppose you want to go out tomorrow night?

Sergio: Sure, I can make it tomorrow. I’ll pick you up around 7:00. Is that okay?

Natalie: Yeah, that works for me. See you tomorrow at 7:00.

Sergio: I’m really looking forward to it.

Natalie: Me, too.

### 0352 Understanding Interest Rates

Kerry: I need to take out a small business loan and I’m trying to figure out what the interest rate would be. Do you understand this stuff?

Oscar: If it’s the same as a mortgage loan, then I think I understand it in general terms. The interest rate would be the percentage of the amount you plan to borrow. It’s usually calculated as an annual rate. So, for instance, a 10 percent interest rate on $100 would be $10 a year.

Kerry: Okay, I see, but how is my monthly payment calculated?

Oscar: As the borrower, your monthly payment depends on the term of your loan. Each month, you’ll pay money toward the principal, plus the interest you owe the lender. The bank may also assess other fees for processing your loan, so make sure to read the fine print.

Kerry: Thanks. I understand it a little better now.

Oscar: Are you sure you want to go down that road? You don’t want to default on your loan and ruin your credit score. Maybe there are other options.

Kerry: Maybe there are, but I just don’t see any right now. I have an appointment with an accountant next week and hopefully she can advise me on the best course of action.

Oscar: Good luck and let me know if I can help.

Kerry: Thanks, I will.

### 0353 Describing the Taste of Food

Steve, my new boyfriend, decided to cook dinner for me. I was really excited, that is, until I tried his cooking.

Steve: What do you think of the soup?

I thought: This is so bland, and what are these little lumpy things in the soup? Of course I didn’t say that aloud.

Elaine: It’s delicious. It has a very interesting flavor.

When Steve served the main course, a baked chicken, he asked,

Steve: What do you think of the chicken? Is it too salty or spicy?

I thought: Yes! It’s too salty and it’s so spicy I can hardly eat it without breathing fire. The outside of the chicken is overcooked and the inside is raw! But out loud, I said,

Elaine: No, not at all! It has an interesting texture and I’m enjoying every bite.

I thought: Oh, no. Is there more? Steve went into the kitchen and brought dessert.

Steve: What do you think of this cake?

I thought: This cake should be sweet, but it has a strange sour taste. Could there be something seriously wrong with Steve’s taste buds? But aloud, I said,

Elaine: It’s yummy. It’s the best cake that anyone has ever made for me.

And it was true. I didn’t care how bad the meal was. It’s the thought that counts.

### 0354 Being Scared

Emily: I’m not going into that house. It’s supposed to be haunted.

Stephen: Come on. Don’t be a coward. You don’t believe in ghosts, do you?

Emily: I don’t, but I’m not taking any chances. Just look at that house! It’s spooky. I’m getting goosebumps just looking at it.

Stephen: You’re only freaking out because you’ve watched too many horror movies. It’s just a house. Now, come on!

Emily: Why are we doing this anyway? Just because your friends dared you to go in doesn’t mean you have to. This is stupid!

Stephen: I took the dare and I told them I’d spend the night in that house. If you’re a scaredy-cat, you can go home right now.

Emily: And let you go in there by yourself? What kind of girlfriend would I be? I’m scared to death, but I’m not going to chicken out. Okay, let’s go before I change my mind.

Stephen: Really? I didn’t think you’d have the nerve. You’re braver than I thought. Don’t worry. Nothing in there can hurt us.

Emily: Famous last words!

### 0355 Finding a Bargain

Manuel: Wow, I’ve never seen so many shopping bags in my life. I can guess where you’ve been.

Georgia: I did go overboard a bit today. I went to the outlet mall and I found some real bargains. Nearly everything was discounted. I was in shopping heaven!

Manuel: I can see that.

Georgia: My favorite store had reduced prices for all of its sweaters, so I bought five. They were already on sale, but the store knocked another $5 off the price. I got them at half-price! I was going to buy three, but the store had a special offer: If you buy four, the fifth one is free.

Manuel: But doesn’t that mean you spent more money, since you bought five sweaters when you only wanted three?

Georgia: How could I resist? They were being sold at bargain basement prices. At another store, the sale items were two for the price of one. I’ve never seen things in that store so cheap.

Manuel: Where are you going now?

Georgia: I’m going back to the outlet stores, of course. I just came home for a little breather. There’s more shopping to be done!

Manuel: Try to leave a few things for the other shoppers!

### 0356 Starting a Franchise Business

Magdalena: Thanks for meeting with me today. I’ve read through the materials your company sent me, but I still have some questions about opening a franchise.

Phil: That’s what I’m here for. What questions can I answer for you?

Magdalena: Well, I’m familiar with the franchise fee, but are there recurring fees not listed in these materials?

Phil: That’s a good question. In addition to the annual franchise fee and the monthly royalties, we also charge a training fee and an advertising fee. Here’s a list of these and other fees.

Magdalena: Oh, that’s very useful, thanks. I was also wondering what kinds of quality controls the franchises are subject to.

Phil: As you know, when you start a franchise, you are buying into a proven formula for success. We offer a turnkey operation and you will be trained on how to run your business, down to the smallest details. To maintain these standards, we conduct spot checks of all of our franchises from time to time and we audit the books of each franchise once a year to make sure that our standards are being met. Only in very rare occasions do franchises lose their franchise rights because they’ve failed to meet our standards.

Magdalena: What if I have problems along the way? What kind of support does the corporate office provide?

Phil: We give our franchises as much support as possible. After all, it’s in our own best interest that you succeed. We provide troubleshooting and training for your management and employees.

Magdalena: I think those are all of the questions I have right now. I really appreciate your time. If I have other questions in the future, can I contact you?

Phil: Certainly. Here’s my card. I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have. Just give me a ring.

Magdalena: Thanks, I’ll do that.

### 0357 Describing Facial Expressions

Marjorie: I wish I could have been there when you told the managers that you were leaving the company and starting your own business!

Pedro: Everyone was taken aback. Dan gave me a dirty look, of course. He’s always looked down his nose at me. As for Sanjaya, if looks could kill...

Marjorie: Sanjaya? I thought if anyone would understand why you wanted to strike out on your own, he would. I honestly don’t know him that well, but I thought he was a happy-go-lucky kind of guy.

Pedro: Maybe I misread him, but he certainly wasn’t grinning ear to ear. He just had a frown on his face the entire time.

Marjorie: What about Wendy? How did she react?

Pedro: I’m not sure what to make of her reaction. She just raised her eyebrows at me. She sort of winced when I broke the news, and then she had a poker face. I really hope she’s not angry with me.

Marjorie: I think you’d know it if she were angry with you. The last time she was mad at me, she was purple with rage. So, aren’t you happy about your big announcement? I don’t get it. Why the long face?

Pedro: I just wonder if I did the right thing by making an announcement, rather than telling each manager individually. I thought it would feel good to spring it on them all at once, but now I’m doubting whether I did the right thing.

Marjorie: It’s no use crying over spilled milk. Forget about the announcement and focus on your new business. You’re going to be big success!

### 0358 Surfing the Internet

Isaiah: Aren’t you supposed to be working?

Nancy: I just thought I would take a break and surf the web a little.

Isaiah: You’d better be careful which sites you visit. You know that Big Brother is watching.

Nancy: The boss told us that, but I don’t believe it. They’re not going to care if I read a blog or check out a forum once in a while.

Isaiah: That may be, but I would suggest clearing your history and your cache after you do that. You never know when someone is going to be checking up on you.

Nancy: Listen, I’ve installed plug-ins and downloaded programs I’m not supposed to onto this computer, and I’ve never gotten into trouble. I think the boss is just using scare tactics to keep us from messing around when we’re supposed to be working.

Isaiah: Like I said, you can dig your own grave if you want to. Vivian was shopping on the Internet on her work computer a couple of weeks ago, and some questionable pop-ups opened when she moved to a new tab. She didn’t notice it, and when the boss went onto her computer to get a document while she was at lunch, he saw it. She was in hot water.

Nancy: Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing. I know how to cover my tracks.

### 0359 A Fist Fight

Isabella: What are you doing?! Why are you trying to hit that guy?

Tony: He deserves it. He insulted you. I’m going to knock his block off!

Isabella: Stop it! Be civilized. This isn’t some free-for-all. You can’t punch a guy just because he said something offensive.

Tony: Oh, yes I can. Let me at him! I’m going to clobber him.

Isabella: If you take another swing at him, he’s going to have you arrested for assault. Get a hold of yourself.

Tony: I’m just trying to defend my sister’s honor. What’s wrong with that?

Isabella: Nothing, but violence isn’t the answer. Let’s get out of here and cool off a little.

Tony: All right, but if I ever see that guy again, he’ll get what’s coming to him.

Isabella: Okay, okay, let’s go. You said he insulted me. What did he say?

Tony: He said you had nice legs. The nerve of that guy!

Isabella: That’s it? He said I had nice legs and you tried to hit him?

Tony: Isn’t that enough? He can’t say those things about my little sister.

Isabella: I think we need to have another talk about you being overprotective. I’m an adult. I can take care of myself.

Tony: Yes, but I’m your big brother and I’m making sure that no one messes with you. That’s what big brothers are for. You don’t have to thank me.

Isabella: Thank you? Uh!

### 0360 A Management Dispute

Jeannie:  Have you heard about the new management dispute? 
 
Salih:  No, what’s happening? 
 
Jeannie:  Well, the CEO is having problems with the head of one of the subsidiaries. 
 
Salih:  Which one? 
 
Jeannie:  Lance Publishing.  Apparently, the head, Bill Riker, is saying that he and the CEO differ too much in their business philosophy and they can’t agree on 
a future direction for the company. 
 
Salih:  I really hope they can settle their dispute soon.  It doesn’t do anybody any good to have so much hostility in the office. 
 
Jeannie:  I hope so, too.  This company can’t afford to have another high-level departure.  We’ve lost so many good people already this past year. 
 
Salih:  We’ve had a lot of bad press, that’s for sure.  It doesn’t matter that our employment contracts have confidentiality agreements.  When somebody is disgruntled, they talk, and they talk loudly and to whomever will listen.   
 
Jeannie:  You’ve got that right.  I just hope none of us gets caught in the crossfire.  I deal with people at Lance Publishing every week. 
 
Salih:  I’m with you.  I’m keeping a low profile and hoping that the whole thing will blow over soon.  What the CEO and the head of Lance Publishing need is a good mediator who can find some way for two incompatible personalities to meet in the middle. 
 
Jeannie:  What do you think the chances are of that happening? 
 
Salih:  Quite frankly, knowing the people involved, I think it has a snowball’s chance in hell!

### 0361 Feeling Lonely

Moving to a new city can be a lonely experience. When I first moved to Los Angeles, I didn’t know anyone and it was hard to strike up new friendships. I’m a pretty sociable person, but it’s still hard meeting new people and even harder to make lasting friendships.

I’ve never been a lone wolf, so being in a new city out on my own was a new experience. Sometimes I liked doing solitary things, but after awhile, I yearned to be around other people. I would go to busy places to people-watch. I would see families walking by, groups of friends hanging out together, and couples arm-inarm, and wished I was walking along with them. When you’re feeling lonely, it sometimes feels like there’s a wall between you and everyone else, a wall that’s not easy to break down.

Slowly, I started to meet people at my new job and to see them outside of work. Having this companionship and camaraderie, especially with people I had a good rapport with, was a welcomed change. In time, I made some good friends and I no longer dreaded the weekends. But, I’ve never forgotten how hard it was in those first months to be a stranger in a new place!

### 0362 Getting In-Flight Service

I pushed the call button to get the attention of the flight attendant.

Flight attendant: Yes? What can I do for you?

Hal: It’s very cold in the cabin. Is it possible to get a blanket?

Flight attendant: We’re out of blankets, but here’s a pillow.

Hal: Okay, thanks. I was asleep during the meal service. Could I get a meal?

Flight attendant: We don’t have any more of the Baked Chicken. We only have the Bean Salad left.

Hal: Oh, okay, I’ll take that. Could I also get a drink?

Flight attendant: What would you like?

Hal: What do you have?

Flight attendant: The complimentary drinks are listed in our in-flight magazine. Beer, wine, and other cocktails are $4.

Hal: I’ll have a diet soda.

Flight attendant: We’re out of diet soda.

Hal: How about just some water? What’s that?

Flight attendant: That’s turbulence. Make sure your seatbelt is fastened.

Hal: Could I get an airsickness bag, please?

Flight attendant: I’m sorry, but we’re out of those, too.

### 0363 Using the Telephone

Charles: I don’t know how long this power outage is going to last. Do you think we should call Elizabeth to tell her we’ll be late for dinner?

Jane: That’s a good idea. Do you know her phone number offhand?

Charles: No, I don’t, and I can’t look it up in my address book or in the phone book without any lights. Oh, wait. I have it programmed into my cell phone. I should be able to use speed dial to call her. Oh, no.

Jane: What’s the matter?

Charles: My cell phone battery is dead.

Jane: Maybe we can use the landline to call directory assistance. The operator should be able to give us her number.

Charles: I doubt it. There must be more than one Elizabeth Bennett in our area code.

Jane: You’re probably right, but I’ll try anyway. Where’s the phone? Oh, here it is. Why aren’t I getting a dial tone?

Charles: Try listening through the earpiece instead of the mouthpiece.

Jane: Oh, right. How do I dial 411 if I can’t see the keypad?

Charles: Hey, the power is back on!

Jane: Not a moment too soon!

### 0364 Filing Taxes

Ricky: Aren’t you done with your taxes yet?

Shawn: No, not yet.

Ricky: Can I help?

Shawn: That would be great. I think I’m almost done, but it’d be great if you could look it over. This is the first year I haven’t been exempt or filed an EZ tax return.

Ricky: No problem. What are brothers for? Okay, you’ve entered your earnings, including your salary and dividends. You have no dependents...

Shawn: I just hope I picked the right number of withholdings. I’d like to get a tax refund, rather than have to pay.

Ricky: Well, you can take the standard deduction here, but I suggest itemizing your medical expenses and your charitable contributions. It may make a big difference in the calculations.

Shawn: Thanks. I’ll crunch the numbers to find out. So what do I owe you for all of this help?

Ricky: That depends on the size of your refund check!

### 0365 Putting the Children to Bed

Andrea: It’s your turn to put the kids to bed.

Marlon: No, I put them to bed last night, didn’t I?

Andrea: Nope, I did that. Don’t forget their bedtime story.

Marlon: The kids won’t let me forget it. Okay, time for bed! Go brush your teeth and put on your pajamas. It’s lights out in 15 minutes.

Andrea: What are you doing?

Marlon: I’m finishing my newspaper.

Andrea: Aren’t you going to watch over them to make sure they’re getting ready for bed?

Marlon: Nope. You have your methods and I have mine.

Andrea: Okay, this I’ve got to see.

Marlon: I don’t hear anyone brushing their teeth. If everyone isn’t in bed in five minutes, they’re going to get a cuddle from Norman.

Andrea: Who’s Norman?

Marlon: Norman is just a little scary monster I told them about. Norman eats little children who aren’t in bed when they’re supposed to be. It’s my way of making sure they stay in bed through the night.

Andrea: That’s terrible! That’ll give them nightmares.

Marlon: Nonsense. It won’t do them any harm. As my father told me, Norman only eats bad children.

### 0366 Talking About Prices

Rosalba: Can you believe these prices? I know we’re in a recession, but the cost of everyday necessities shouldn’t skyrocket overnight.

William: I think it has something to do with the shortage of produce. I don’t know why I’m surprised that stores like this one try to gouge customers at the drop of a hat. I guess it’s par for the course – anything to make a little extra money.

Rosalba: You said it! Even when there’s a good supply, the prices are never dirt cheap. Any savings the stores get are never passed on to the customers.

William: I have a mind to stop buying fruits and vegetables until the prices go down.

Rosalba: You mean a boycott?

William: Yeah, I won’t eat any fruits and vegetables until these high prices come down.

Rosalba: How long do you think you can keep that up?

William: I don’t know, but let’s find out!

### 0367 Going into the Military

Chantelle: Attention! Aren’t you supposed to salute?

Robert: You’re not my superior officer. Stop goofing around. I’m busy.

Chantelle: You’re packing already? You don’t need to report to duty for two days. Are you afraid they’ll think you went AWOL?

Robert: I just want to be prepared. Now, leave me alone so I can finish packing.

Chantelle: Am I dismissed? Maybe I want to enlist, too? I think I would look good in camouflage make-up and fatigues.

Robert: Being in the military is no laughing matter. Do you really think that the most desperate recruiter would want you?

Chantelle: That’s not very nice. I have as much discipline as you do...about some things. You may find yourself in a foxhole with me someday.

Robert: Whatever deployment you’d get, I’d make sure I’m on the other side of the world!

### 0368 A Corporate Takeover

Lee: Hello, Lee Williams.

Bruce: Hi, Lee. This is Bruce Eng. The reason I’m calling is to find out if there is any news about your company’s takeover bid for Shamrock Corp. It’s been a week and I was wondering what’s happening.

Lee: Hi, Bruce. I’m glad you called. I was just about to call you with an update. Here’s where we are. The offer we made to Shamrock was rejected by the board on Tuesday. Our company’s board of directors has been meeting all week to decide the next course of action.

Bruce: Is there any chance that this could turn into a hostile takeover?

Lee: There is a distinct possibility. Our company is hoping to avoid that since we had hoped to do extensive due diligence, but a hostile takeover may be the only option right now if we decide to move ahead with this.

Bruce: Would the banks go for little or no due diligence? I thought that their support of the takeover bid was contingent on getting more information about the state of Shamrock’s finances.

Lee: You’re right and that may be the stumbling block.

Bruce: Okay, well, call me if you get more information.

Lee: I will. You can count on it.

### 0369 Going to Happy Hour

Gary: Hey, over here. I’m glad you could make it. This place has a great happy hour. Let me get the waitress, Brenda, so we can order our drinks.

Shanise: Hi, Gary. You sound like a regular. Do you come here a lot?

Gary: Yeah, I like stopping by on my way home now and then to wind down.

Shanise: Is there another barstool?

Gary: Oh, sorry. Let me get another one for you. Have a seat. What will you have?

Shanise: I’ll have a scotch, straight up. I usually don’t drink very much. Alcohol sometimes doesn’t agree with me. I’ve had a tough day, though, and I need to loosen up.

Gary: Okay, one scotch coming up. Here comes the waitress. Okay, that’s one scotch for Shanise and a draft beer for me. On second thought, bring a pitcher of the draft beer, would you? Thanks, Brenda.

Shanise: I’m starving. The sign outside says that they have all-you-can-eat appetizers during happy hour. Is that right?

Gary: Right you are, and they have specials on everything on their menu.

Shanise: I don’t usually go to happy hours, but I like this place. I’m glad you invited me to come.

Gary: Would I steer you wrong? Now let’s get some grub.

### 0370 Describing a Bad Experience

Caterina: I can’t believe I let you rope me into seeing this performance. It was so lame!

Oliver: Okay, you’re right, it was the pits. I had no idea it was going to be amateur hour. When I saw the ad in the paper describing this as an experimental play, I thought it might be interesting. Was I wrong!

Caterina: I didn’t understand that play at all. The music, if you can call it that, was atrocious. How can anyone be expected to listen to that for more than three seconds without going crazy? I wish I could get those two hours of my life back!

Oliver: Yeah, it’s left a bad taste in my mouth, too. Let’s go see something else. I want to put this whole experience behind me.

Caterina: Benjamin’s Bar is having open-mic tonight. Do you want to check it out?

Oliver: No way! Wild horses couldn’t drag me to another amateur show. How about a movie instead?

Caterina: Okay, I’d go to a movie.

Oliver: You’d better pick one, though. Look what happened when I was left to pick a play.

Caterina: Forget about it. We’ll just chalk it up to temporary insanity.

### 0371 A Scandal

Caridad: Look at this! The president of McQuillan University is stepping down. He submitted his resignation this morning after an undergraduate student made allegations that they had an affair and that she’s pregnant with his baby.

Nate: That’s terrible. Maybe they were in love.

Caridad: In love? He’s married and has four kids, and when she first went public about the affair, he denied it and said that she had made up the whole story. Would someone in love try to cover up something like this?

Nate: Who knows? The president of a major university is a person with a lot to lose. I’m not making excuses for him, but maybe he lost his head.

Caridad: Of course he had a lot to lose. Anyone who is in the public eye like he is shouldn’t be playing with fire. He’s an embarrassment to his family and to his university.

Nate: I still think there could be extenuating circumstances. All you know you’ve learned from one newspaper article.

Caridad: That much is true, but I know one thing: Whatever happens to him, it serves him right!

### 0372 A Bully at Work

Wanda: I can’t take it anymore. I try to put up with Robert, but I’ve had enough!

Dana: I’m not surprised. That guy is a big bully and it’s time somebody stood up to him. What has he done now?

Wanda: This was the last straw. We’re both managers and we’re supposed to work together, but Robert looks for every opportunity to put me down in front of our employees. This morning, I presented an idea about upgrading our computer equipment and he jumped down my throat.

Dana: What did he do?

Wanda: He said that the idea was stupid and that he couldn’t understand how anyone could propose it. He said this in front of everybody. I was too stunned to respond, so I just stood there.

Dana: That’s totally inappropriate and unprofessional.

Wanda: He’s arrogant to everybody, but especially to me. He always says he’s just being honest when he makes a biting remark, but I’m realizing that that’s just his excuse to be rude. He treats everyone with contempt. I really don’t know what to do.

Dana: I know people like Robert. They’re so insecure that they have to belittle everyone else to make themselves feel better. They have really poor social skills and don’t know how to have a conversation or to disagree without being a jerk.

Wanda: That may be, but what should I do about him?

Dana: There’s only one way to handle a bully.

Wanda: How?

Dana: You have to call his bluff. If he criticizes your plan, ask him to back it up with evidence or a specific reason. If you disagree with him, keep your cool, but tell him why. Most bullies back down when someone stands up to them.

Wanda: Okay, it’s worth a try. I’ve been trying to keep calm and maintain a professional atmosphere in the office, so I haven’t confronted him, but I will if you think it’ll help.

Dana: I do. And if that doesn’t work, tell him to act his age, not his shoe size!

### 0373 Ordering Food Delivery

Order clerk: Hello, Torino’s Restaurant.

Nancy: Hello, I’d like to place a delivery order.

Order clerk: Can I have your address and the major cross streets, please?

Nancy: It’s 1212 Main Street, and the nearest cross streets are Speedway and Highland.

Order clerk: Okay, it looks like you’re in our delivery area. What would you like to order?

Nancy: I’d like an order of spaghetti. Does that come with any sides?

Order clerk: You have a choice of soup or salad.

Nancy: I’ll have the salad.

Order clerk: Is that all? We have a $15 minimum for delivery orders.

Nancy: In that case, I’ll also take an appetizer sampler plate.

Order clerk: Okay, that’s one order of spaghetti and an appetizer sampler plate. You’re still $3 short. Would you like a drink or some dessert?

Nancy: I’ll take an iced tea.

Order clerk: All right, but you’re still a dollar short.

Nancy: What can I get for a dollar?

Order clerk: There’s nothing on the menu for a dollar, ma’am.

Nancy: And you won’t deliver my $14 order?

Order clerk: That’s our policy, ma’am.

Nancy: All right, you win. Give me an order of bread. How long will that take?

Order clerk: You should get your food in about an hour.

Nancy: An hour?!?

Order clerk: Yes, ma’am. You’ve ordered a lot of food and it takes time for us to prepare it.

### 0374 A Graduation Ceremony

Rafael: They’re playing Pomp and Circumstance and the graduates are filing in. Do you see your daughter? I don’t see my son.

April: No, we’re too far from the field and everybody is wearing a cap and gown. It’s hard to see who’s who.

Rafael: Oh, there’s the dean and I think that’s the commencement speaker behind her. You must be really proud of your daughter. I know I would be if my son were valedictorian.

April: I’m very proud of her, but your son is graduating cum laude, with honors. Those are great accomplishments.

Rafael: It’s a proud day for both of us. I just hope that the graduates will keep this a dignified ceremony. I don’t want to see any shenanigans.

April: What do you mean?

Rafael: Last year when my other son graduated, a group of rowdy students started singing an offensive song as the graduates went up to get their diplomas.

April: Hey, what’s that over there?

Rafael: Where? Oh, that’s a beach ball! How dare they throw a beach ball around while the dean is speaking!

April: Don’t look now. Those students are doing something strange with their tassels.

Rafael: Shame on them! Shame on every one of them!

### 0375 A Call from a Telemarketer

Doris: Hello.

Telemarketer: Hello, may I speak to the lady of the house?

Doris: What is this regarding?

Telemarketer: I’m calling from Cheetam Cable Company and we have a very special offer. This month only, you can get a bundle of services for the low, low price of $69.99! This offer...

Doris: Thank you, but I’m not interested.

Telemarketer: But that’s because you haven’t heard the rest of the offer yet. If you sign up today, you will get at no extra charge, all of the equipment you’ll need to switch to our cable company.

Doris: As I said, I’m not interested. I’m also on the national do-not-call registry and I want to be taken off your call list.

Telemarketer: If you’re on my list, it means that you have a prior relationship with our company and telemarketers are allowed to call you. Now about that special offer...

Doris: I don’t want to hear your sales pitch. I demand to be taken off your call list and I don’t want to get any more calls from your company.

Telemarketer: Is that a “no” on the special offer?

Doris: Yes, that’s a “no” on the special offer and a “no” on getting any more calls from your company. Do I make myself clear?

Telemarketer: Yes, very clear. If you’re not interested in our special offer, I can tell you about our other services...

Doris: No you can’t! [Hangs up the phone]

### 0376 Asking About Business Hours

Store owner: Hello.

Karin: Hello, is this Joe’s Shoe Repair?

Store owner: Yes, how can I help you?

Karin: I’m calling to find out your business hours.

Store owner: We’re open 24/7.

Karin: Really? You’re open 24 hours a day, seven days a week?

Store owner: Yes, we are, more often than not. Of course we close for major holidays.

Karin: Is that all?

Store owner: We also close the first and third Monday and every other Sunday of each month, except the fourth Sunday, when we’re always open 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., unless we have extended hours.

Karin: Oh, okay. If I brought in a pair of shoes to be fixed today, how quickly can you have them ready?

Store owner: Normally, we can have shoes repaired in three or four days, but not this week.

Karin: Why?

Store owner: We’re closed Wednesday through Friday for renovation.

Karin: Okay, what if I brought them in next week?

Store owner: That’s no good either. The exterminators are coming in and we’re closed Monday through Thursday.

Karin: Are you pulling my leg?

Store owner: Of course not! This is a respectable business. I never joke about business.

Karin: How about the week after next?

Store owner: Sorry, but you’re out of luck. The week after next we’re closed for vacation.

Karin: When do you actually open 24/7?

Store owner: We’re always open 24/7 – with just a few exceptions.

### 0377 Reporting a Stolen Car

Kenji: Hello, my car was stolen and I want to report it.

Officer: Where was it when it was stolen?

Kenji: It was parked outside of my apartment building. I went outside this morning to drive to work, and it was gone.

Officer: Okay, you need to fill out this form. Put down the make and model of the vehicle, the year, and the color. You’ll also need the license plate number. Do you know the vehicle’s VIN number?

Kenji: No, I don’t.

Officer: That’s okay. Just fill it out and we’ll launch an investigation.

Kenji: What do you think the chances are that I’ll recover my car?

Officer: That’s hard to say. If it was stolen by some kids who wanted to take a joyride, they’ll abandon it afterwards and you may get it back in one piece. If it was taken by professional car thieves, that’s a different story. They usually strip the cars of their parts and sell them to chop shops. You may not want your car back after it’s been stripped.

Kenji: I’ll just have to wish for the best.

Officer: We’ll notify you if we have some news.

Kenji: Thanks. In the meantime, I’d better get used to hoofing it around town!

### 0378 Talking About Time

Juanita: What time is it?

Chuck: It’s a quarter to 12. Why?

Juanita: At noon, on the dot, I’m supposed to meet James.

Chuck: On the dot? What if you don’t get there until a few minutes past four? Will you turn into a pumpkin?

Juanita: Knock it off. I have good reason to be on time. I was supposed to meet him at the movies at 8:30 last Saturday and I didn’t turn up until 10 ‘til 9:00. We missed the first 10 minutes of the movie.

Chuck: That doesn’t sound too bad.

Juanita: You don’t know the half of it. The week before that, I was supposed to pick him up from work at a quarter after 5:00, and I didn’t show up until nearly 20 minutes to six. To add insult to injury, James’ boss saw that he was still in the office and gave him an extra assignment to do that night and he didn’t finish until well after 10:00.

Chuck: I can see why he’s pissed off at you.

Juanita: What time is it now?

Chuck: It’s 12:03.

Juanita: Oh my god! I’m late again! What am I going to tell him?

Chuck: Tell him it was all my fault. My incredible charm made you lose track of time.

### 0379 A Routine Procedure

Julia: Aren’t you nervous about your surgery next week?

Hugh: No, it’s a routine procedure. I don’t even need to be admitted overnight.

Julia: But aren’t you going under general anesthesia? It’s not the same as local anesthesia, you know.

Hugh: Yes, I know. This is an out-patient procedure. If the doctors don’t think I can go home the same day, they’ll just keep me under observation.

Julia: All the same, there may be complications.

Hugh: It’s supposed to be a low-risk procedure. If there are post-op problems, I’m sure the doctors will take good care of me.

Julia: But what if they release you too early from the hospital. I’ve heard that these days doctors are under pressure to free up beds as soon as possible.

Hugh: It’s true that I may be impaired after the procedure, but my daughter will be there and I trust her judgment. I’m sure she’ll make sure I’m fine to go home before I’m discharged.

Julia: But what if...?

Hugh: Don’t worry. Nothing bad is going to happen. If it does, you can say, “I told you so.”

### 0380 Hiring Temp Workers

Bethany: I just talked to Steve about hiring replacements for Cyril, who quit last month and for Megan, who is leaving at the end of this week. Do you know what he told me? He doesn’t want to hire permanent replacements. He wants to make do with temps!

Enrique: I can see it from Steve’s perspective. The economy isn’t so good right now and maybe he’s not sure if we can afford full-time replacements.

Bethany: But how am I supposed to staff the office to cover all of the work that needs to be done with temps?!

Enrique: Don’t undervalue temps. Many of them are very skilled and you may be surprised at how well they do. I should know. I worked as a temp right after graduating from college.

Bethany: You did? I didn’t know that. But you went to a great school. I’m surprised you had trouble landing a full-time job.

Enrique: Actually, I was offered a full-time job before I graduated, but I turned it down. I decided I wanted to test the waters in a few different companies before deciding on where I wanted to work. In retrospect, it was the best thing I could have done.

Bethany: You didn’t miss the job security?

Enrique: Yeah, I did, but there are other perks to working as a temp. I got offered permanent jobs with two of the companies I temped for. That’s how I got my first full-time job. Working there was the best way to get my foot in the door.

Bethany: Well, thanks for the fresh perspective. Maybe working with temps won’t be so bad.

Enrique: I hope not. And if they get out of line, just tell me and I’ll set them straight.

Bethany: Yeah, right.

### 0381 Watching the TV News

Anchor: Good evening. I’m Gary Singh and this is the evening news. Tonight, we’ll have a special report from our field reporter, Monique Sanders, on the latest developments in the Eddie Litton court case. And in our feature segment, we’ll go to Arizona to interview the world’s fattest dog, weighing 210 pounds! We’ll also have this week’s weather and the latest on sports.

But first, our top story: A man suspected of murdering his business partner led the police on a high-speed chase through downtown this afternoon. Reporting live from downtown Los Angeles is Tanisha Gray. Tanisha?

Tanisha: Thanks, Gary. About three hours ago, the police cordoned off a half-mile area around City Hall after the suspect ran into one of the City Hall offices and took two women as hostages. After a nearly two-hour standoff, the suspect surrendered. Neither of the two women was hurt and the suspect is now in police custody. Back to you, Gary, in the studio.

Anchor: Thanks for that report, Tanisha. We’ll have more for you as this story develops.

### 0382 Types of Hotels and Accommodations

Jamal: Have you found a place for us to stay in Chicago?

Erin: I’m still exploring the options. Instead of a run-of-the-mill chain hotel, I thought we could do something different.

Jamal: How different?

Erin: I thought we might stay in a cabin near the lake.

Jamal: A cabin? That sounds a little too rustic for me. My days of roughing it in hostels or fleabag motels are over. A cabin sounds like it would be in the same league.

Erin: Oh, I don’t know. There are some very nice cabins, and even if they’re less than luxurious, I don’t mind staying in a modest place. We can’t afford an expensive boutique hotel, you know.

Jamal: I know that, but there are a lot of other options. We could stay in a bed and breakfast or a vacation rental. Remember the bed and breakfast we stayed in in Montreal?

Erin: Yeah, that was nice. Okay, you win. I was trying to appeal to your adventurous spirit.

Jamal: My adventurous spirit is still here. It just needs the right inducement.

### 0383 Mending a Broken Heart

David: Why has Joyce been moping around all week? What’s wrong with her?

Victoria: She’s suffering from a broken heart. Her boyfriend broke up with her over the weekend. They had been together for two years.

David: Did she tell you the gruesome details?

Victoria: Not really. She just said that she’s feeling depressed and she didn’t want to talk about it, but you can see the grief all over her face.

David: I can think of a way to cheer her up. I’ve always wanted to go out with Joyce. Maybe I’ll ask her out.

Victoria: Wait a second. I think she’s feeling pretty vulnerable right now, and there’s no way she’s ready to date yet. I think you’re jumping the gun.

David: There’s nothing better to help someone bounce back from a failed relationship than the promise of a new one.

Victoria: Maybe, but I think it might backfire. If you just want a fling, she might not be able to recover from rejection – twice.

David: Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing. I’ll just distract her from her misery for a while until she starts to recover.

Victoria: Just tread carefully.

David: Leave it to the master.

### 0384 Accepting Credit Cards

Danny: Are you sure we should start accepting credit cards from our customers? We’ve always been a cash-only business.

Katy: I think we need to for the convenience of our customers. It won’t be as big a nuisance as you think, with this new cash register.

Danny: The instructions say the merchant has to swipe the cardholder’s card at the POS. What’s that?

Katy: That stands for point of sale. For us, that’s the cash register. All you have to do is take the credit card and swipe it through here, making sure that the magnetic strip is facing you. It’s simple.

Danny: Do I have to write down the credit card number, the expiration date, and the security code on the back?

Katy: No, the cash register does that for you automatically. It will save you a lot of time.

Danny: What if the customer goes over his or her credit limit?

Katy: In that case, their card is declined and we tell the customer to call the issuing bank.

Danny: What if a customer disputes the charges?

Katy: The credit card company will investigate, and if we have double-charged a customer or made a mistake, we’ll have to do a chargeback. We can do it easily with the cash register. Everything can be done with this machine. It’s great.

Danny: What if it doesn’t work?

Katy: What if what doesn’t work?

Danny: What if the cash register breaks down?

Katy: Um...I guess you’ll have to write down all of the information and process it when the machine is working again.

Danny: Not such a timesaver, huh?

Katy: But you only have to do that if it breaks down, and it won’t break down...very often.

Danny: We’ll see about that!

### 0385 Exercising at the Gym

Jae: Hi, are you done with this weight machine?

Sally: Yeah, I am. I was just trying it out. I think I must be doing something wrong. My muscles are aching already.

Jae: Maybe I can help. I’ve been working out on these machines for a few months, so I’m pretty used to them.

Sally: I just joined the gym this week. I usually do a cardio workout on a treadmill or stationary bike, and I’ve used free weights at home before. But now it makes sense to do my strength-training here.

Jae: Have you thought about getting a personal trainer? When I joined, I signed up for a trainer for a few sessions and she helped me set up a good regimen.

Sally: That’s a good idea.

Jae: If you want help with those machines, though, I’m usually here every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Sally: Thanks, I’ll definitely look out for you. I’m Sally.

Jae: I’m Jae. Nice to meet you.

Sally: You, too. I think I’ve sweated enough today. I’m off to the locker room.

Jae: Yeah, me too. See ya!

Sally: Bye!

### 0386 Learning How to Drive

Xavier: Look out! Put your foot on the brake!

Brandy: I am braking.

Xavier: No, your foot is on the gas pedal!

Brandy: Oh. There’s the brake.

Xavier: You just took 10 years off my life. I was sure you were going to hit the median or the railing. I didn’t know what I was getting into when I agreed to teach you how to drive.

Brandy: Relax. I’m really getting the hang of this. Shifting gears isn’t as hard as I thought it would be, it’s cool to parallel park, and driving in reverse is fun!

Xavier: Would you please keep your hands on the steering wheel, instead of playing with the radio? Keep your eyes on the speedometer and stop using the rearview mirror to look at yourself.

Brandy: And you stop working yourself into a tizzy. I’m a fine driver.

Xavier: I don’t think those people you’re about to hit would agree with you.

Brandy: If they don’t like the way I drive, they should get off the sidewalk!

### 0387 Describing Talent and Ability

Kathy: Thanks for inviting me to see your team. Who’s your best player?

Brad: That would be Sarah. She’s a natural. No one comes close to her speed and dexterity. She has good instincts and a flair for getting out of difficult situations.

Kathy: She sounds promising. Anyone else I should be keeping an eye on?

Brad: Mollie is a good player, too. In terms of scoring points, she can almost do it in her sleep. She’s also very good at being a leader to the other players, and she has a knack for getting along with even the most difficult teammates.

Kathy: As you know, we recruit only first-rate players for the national team, and this year, we hope to be head and shoulders above any of the other teams. The days of making do with mediocre players are over.

Brad: I understand that. We have a game this Saturday. Why don’t you come out and judge for yourself? I think you’ll be impressed with the talent you see.

Kathy: I’m sure I will. I’ll be here on Saturday ready to be dazzled.

### 0389 Getting a Cold

Walt: What’s the matter with you?

Irene: I have a bad cold.

Walt: Why didn’t you stay home from work? You’re probably contagious!

Irene: I had no choice. I have an important presentation this afternoon and I can’t play hooky.

Walt: You can’t give a presentation in your condition. Your nose is running, your eyes are red and puffy, your voice is hoarse, and you look like you’re running a fever.

Irene: Gee, thanks. I know I look terrible, but I’ll get through it. I’m taking a nasal decongestant, I’m using eye drops, and I’m taking cough medicine and sucking on throat lozenges. I should be better by the time of the presentation. Ahchoo!

Walt: Oh, geez! You just sneezed all over me. You’ve contaminated me for sure!

Irene: Sorry. Where’s the Kleenex? I need to blow my nose.

Walt: I’m out of here! You’re a walking germ machine.

### 0390 Dietary Restrictions and Preferences

Tony: Who did you invite over for dinner Saturday?

Carmela: I invited Keith, Sung, Stephanie, and Luis.

Tony: You didn’t!

Carmela: I did. Why?

Tony: You’re going to have a hard time cooking for them. Keith is a vegan and only eats food that’s organic. Sung is lactose intolerant and his doctor put him on a low-salt diet.

Carmela: Really? I didn’t know. How do you know so much about their diets?

Tony: I went on a trip with them and I’ll never do it again. We could never agree on a restaurant.

Carmela: What about Stephanie and Luis?

Tony: Stephanie is a health nut, and doesn’t eat anything with saturated fat, added sugar, or artificial flavors. She also doesn’t eat red meat. And Luis, he can only eat gluten-free kosher foods.

Carmela: This is a disaster. How am I going to cook for all four of them?

Tony: Beats me. Maybe you can turn it into a potluck. At least each of your guests will have one dish they can eat.

Carmela: I can’t invite my friends over for dinner and then tell them to bring their own food!

Tony: Well, you wanted a solution and beggars can’t be choosers.

Carmela: You’re right. Desperate times call for desperate measures!

### 0391 Traveling and Medical Needs

Delia: Oh, my feet hurt! We must have walked for four hours straight today. I have blisters on my heels and bruises on my toes. Where are my band-aids?

Yoshi: Yeah, your feet look bad. I told you not to wear new shoes on vacation, but you wouldn’t listen.

Delia: Oh, yeah? Look at you! I told you to put on sunscreen, and did you? Your face and neck are sunburned. Your skin is going to be red and peeling tomorrow.

Yoshi: I’ll be fine. If it weren’t for my stomachache, I’d be ready to walk another four hours.

Delia: I told you not to eat food from street vendors.

Yoshi: My stomach is just feeling a little irritated and I have a little diarrhea. It’s nothing serious.

Delia: You probably have salmonella or food poisoning.

Yoshi: No, I don’t! Don’t be ridiculous. Here are some band-aids. Now leave me in peace.

Delia: Fine. I’ll let you suffer in silence. I won’t say another word.

Yoshi: Will miracles never cease?

### 0392 An Untrustworthy Co-worker

Vicky: Did I imagine it or did you just give Gavin the cold shoulder?

Gerard: You didn’t imagine it. I’m not too happy with him.

Vicky: Why? What did he do?

Gerard: He’s two-faced, that’s why. Last week, he told me he was going to put in a good word for me with the manager for a promotion.

Vicky: So that sounds like a nice thing to do.

Gerard: I thought so, too. But as it turns out, I heard from Elanda that he was bad-mouthing me behind my back.

Vicky: Are you sure?

Gerard: I’m sure. He told Elanda that he thought I had gone pretty far in the company for someone who had dropped out of college. That’s a backhanded compliment, if I’ve ever heard one.

Vicky: That sounds pretty nasty. At least the manager wasn’t around.

Gerard: She wasn’t, but who’s to say what he told her behind my back?

Vicky: You know, the manager is pretty sharp and nothing gets by her. I’m sure she’ll put two and two together and realize that Gavin isn’t trustworthy.

Gerard: I hope so. With friends like him, who needs enemies!

### 0393 Trash and Recycling

Rajid: What are you doing?

Nicole: I’m putting my garbage into the garbage can. Why?

Rajid: Don’t you recycle? You’re supposed to separate out your recyclables and put them in a separate bin.

Nicole: I know, I know, but who has the time? I don’t have that much trash anyway.

Rajid: Oh, yeah? The dump is full of food containers that aren’t biodegradable from people who didn’t have the time.

Nicole: Come on. Don’t blow things out of proportion. It’s not like I’m going to save the environment all by myself.

Rajid: No, you’re not, but if everybody thinks the same way you do, we’re going to use up all of our natural resources.

Nicole: When did you turn into an ecologist? I don’t see you conserving energy. You have your lights on all night. I can see them through your window.

Rajid: I use energy-efficient bulbs. Besides, I take my recyclables to the recycling center, I have energy-efficient appliances, and I turn down my thermostat.

Nicole: I’m just saying that you’re not doing everything you can to save the environment. Okay, okay. Put your money where your mouth is and help me separate out my recyclables.

Rajid: Me? You want me to help you sort through your garbage?

Nicole: Since you’re the expert, I need you to show me how.

### 0394 Describing Hatred and Anger

Danica: Calm down! Stop throwing things! Have you gone berserk?

Neil: Calm down?! Calm down?! You don’t know what just happened.

Danica: I’ve never seen you lose your temper like this before. Take a deep breath and tell me what happened.

Neil: Okay, you know that I like Samantha, right? Well, I told Malik last week. I just found out today that he’s dating her.

Danica: Malik? But he’s your best friend. He wouldn’t do that.

Neil: Do you think I’d be having a fit if I weren’t absolutely certain?

Danica: How can you be so sure? Did he tell you?

Neil: He didn’t have to. I saw him with Samantha together after work. He had his arm around her! I was ready to go off the deep end when I saw the two of them together.

Danica: How do you know he wasn’t sweet-talking her for you? He could have been putting in a good word for you, you know.

Neil: That’s bull! That guy is a traitor and I despise him. And I’m such a schmuck for trusting him.

Danica: Well, I still think you may have gotten the wrong idea. Are you going to talk to him about it?

Neil: You bet I am, just as soon as I stop foaming at the mouth.

### 0395 Watching the Olympic Games

Mary Lou: Am I too late for the opening ceremony?

Jesse: No, it’s just starting. The runner is just coming into Olympic Village with the torch.

Mary Lou: Oh, this is so exciting! I love the summer Olympics. Track and field, gymnastics, swimming – I can’t wait!

Jesse: Oh, here come the athletes from each country, with their flag bearer in front. Look at all those gold, silver, and bronze medalists.

Mary Lou: Isn’t it funny that that country only has one competitor?

Jesse: No way! Can you imagine the accolades you’d get as the only athlete from your country that’s of Olympic caliber? I’d trade places with her any day.

Mary Lou: This schedule says that the track and field events begin tomorrow.

Jesse: Yeah, but those are just the qualifying heats. The real races don’t start for three days. What’s that?

Mary Lou: My flag. I’m cheering on the U.S. team.

Jesse: From the living room?

Mary Lou: Sure, why not? It can’t hurt, can it?

### 0396 Dealing in the Black Market

Jasinda: Was that your friend Mitch?

Thomas: Yeah, he and I had lunch today to talk about some business opportunities.

Jasinda: What line of work is he in?

Thomas: Well, I guess you could say he’s in the import/export business.

Jasinda: Hmm…Why are you being so shifty? Isn’t his business on the up and up? He doesn’t deal in the black market, does he?

Thomas: Let’s just say that he takes full advantage of a free market and there’s nothing wrong with the gray market.

Jasinda: You’re not telling me he deals in stolen goods, are you?

Thomas: No, no, nothing like that. Don’t be so naive. There is an entire underground economy in this country, which serves an important purpose. It gets people what they want.

Jasinda: Is he a smuggler? Does he deal in counterfeit or pirated goods? Is that it?

Thomas: I’m not saying another word.

Jasinda: You did say that you were having lunch to talk about business opportunities. You’re not thinking of going into business with him, are you?

Thomas: It was just talk. Nothing is set in stone – yet.

### 0397 Being a Divorced Parent

Oscar: How are you adjusting to being a single parent?

Penny: It hasn’t been easy, but Paul and I are trying to be as civil as possible. We worked out joint custody so that Mina will get quality time with both of us. Still, it’s been an adjustment for her.

Oscar: I’m sure, and for you and Paul, too. Will you get to see Mina when she’s with her father?

Penny: We each have visitation rights. Fortunately, Paul and I both want what’s best for Mina, so we’re working hard to make the right decisions.

Oscar: If you don’t mind my asking, how are you managing financially?

Penny: Neither of us is paying alimony to the other so that was never an issue, but Paul will be paying child support since I’ll have Mina most of the year. Paul had no objections. He’s been amenable to anything that would be good for Mina.

Oscar: How has Mina been reacting to the whole thing?

Penny: She has been acting out, which is to be expected. Paul’s parents and my mother have been very supportive, and we’re all trying to give her as much stability as possible.

Oscar: It sounds like you’re doing all you can.

Penny: We’re trying our best, under the circumstances.

### 0398 Parts of a City

Tanya: We’ve been here for three days and I’m still getting lost.

Darren: Here’s a map. These are the residential neighborhoods. See? This is where we’re staying.

Tanya: I know, I know. But where were we today? The tour bus went down so many alleys that I lost my bearings after 10 minutes. I thought we were going in circles.

Darren: Look, we drove through downtown first, past the financial district. Next, we drove past the housing projects to the historic district.

Tanya: I remember all that.

Darren: Okay, then. From the historic district, we drove through uptown. Got that?

Tanya: Yeah, that’s where things get a little hazy. How did we get to the outskirts of town? One minute we were in uptown, and the next minute, we were at the city limits.

Darren: We took one of the back roads along here. See? Now do you understand the lay of the land?

Tanya: Yup, definitely. Ask me anything. I know this city like the back of my hand.

Darren: No, thanks. That’s like the blind leading the blind!

### 0399 A Bachelor Party

My best friend, Saul, is getting married. As the best man, it was up to me to plan a bachelor party he’d never forget. All of the groomsmen were chipping in, so we went all out.

I invited everybody over to my apartment. Instead of going to a strip club, we hired a stripper. Before the stripper arrived, we played some drinking games and we gave Saul some gag gifts. We all started to get pretty bombed, but we weren’t thinking of the hangover we’d have the next day.

When the stripper arrived, we told “her” to give Saul a lap dance. He had never had one before and he was really embarrassed! But the best part was when Saul saw the stripper: It was a man! Everyone had a good laugh, and we took some pictures so we’d have incriminating evidence. We poked fun at him for the rest of the night.

And as best man, what was my most important job of all? It was not letting his fiancée find out what happened that night – at least not before the wedding!

### 0400 Working in a Dead End Job

Agency employee: Tell me why you’d like to sign up with our employment agency.

Kurt: Well, right now I’m working in a dead end job. There are no opportunities for advancement. I’m already at the top of the pay scale, so there’s no chance of another pay raise.

Agency employee: Okay, I’d like to find out a little more about your employment history. Tell me about your last job.

Kurt: Oh, that was a mind-numbing position. I did menial work all day and I burned out in six months.

Agency employee: What about the job you had before that?

Kurt: The problem with that job was that there was a glass ceiling. They would never promote a person like me.

Agency employee: And what about the job you had before that?

Kurt: I only took that job as a steppingstone to the next one, but it turned out to be a stumbling block instead. My boss didn’t like me and wouldn’t give me a good reference.

Agency employee: Okay, so you were not happy with any of the jobs you’ve had.

Kurt: No, they weren’t right for me. I don’t want to be trapped in a dead end job. I want something that will give me personal satisfaction.

Agency employee: I see. Well, we’ll do the best we can. Have you considered working at an employment agency? I’m looking for a new job myself.

### 0401 Giving Warnings and Cautions

Brett: Hi, Mom. Come in. Welcome to my new place. My roommates aren’t here right now or I’d introduce you.

Mom: Hi, dear. This is…uh…nice.

Brett: It is, isn’t it? I know you were a little worried about me moving out and into a house with five roommates. But as you can see, this is a nice place. Let me give you a tour.

Mom: Oh, okay. Isn’t it a little cramped in the house with six people?

Brett: No way! Come on. I’ll show you the rest of the house. Let’s go this way to the kitchen. Watch out for that hole in the floor. I don’t want you to trip. And don’t worry about the “Do Not Cross – Police Line” tape. It’s just a joke.

Mom: This is the kitchen? Why are all of your dishes on the floor? What do you keep in your cupboards?

Brett: Be careful opening them! We’re short on closet space so some of the guys keep their clothes and shoes in them. You never know what you’ll find if you open one. We just have to watch our step when we walk around the kitchen. Come on, I’ll show you the bathroom.

Mom: You only have one bathroom for six people?

Brett: We’re guys so we don’t really need more than one bathroom. I just have to pay attention to when people take showers if I want enough hot water for my own shower. Watch your head!

Mom: Too late for the heads up! Something just fell on my head.

Brett: Oh, it’s nothing. It’s just a little problem with the ceiling.

Mom: Look out! I think the ceiling is falling down! This place is dangerous!

Brett: It’s nothing. Don’t worry. As long as we stay alert, this is a great place to live.

### 0402 Buying Back-to-School Supplies

Svetlana: Tomorrow is the first day of junior high. Are you ready?

Quinn: Sure, it’s not that big a deal. I already put some supplies in my new backpack.

Svetlana: Let’s see. You have some folders, a three-ring binder, and a pen. Is that all you’re bringing to school?

Quinn: I don’t have my books yet. I’ll get those tomorrow morning. What else do I need? I’m not in the second grade. I don’t need things like glue, crayons, and construction paper.

Svetlana: No, but you’re missing a lot of stuff. I should know. You have a pen, but no pencils. You have no erasers or highlighters. You have a three-ring binder, but you don’t have any ruled paper or a notebook.

Quinn: I don’t need all of that stuff on the first day!

Svetlana: You want to be prepared, don’t you? Where are your index cards? Don’t you have a calculator? You’ll need it for your math class.

Quinn: Are you kidding me?! If I carry all of that plus my books, who will carry me to class?

### 0403 Understanding Drug Labels

Bernie: Oh, I’m in so much pain! Where is the medication we got from the pharmacy?

Gloria: It’s right here, but we need to read the label first. Okay, these are the active ingredients and they seem okay. This warning says that we need to watch out for any allergic reactions. It also says to ask your doctor before using it if you have heart problems.

Bernie: I don’t. Can you just give me the medication?

Gloria: I’m checking to make sure the seal under the cap isn’t broken, just to be on the safe side. I also need to read the dosage information so you’ll know how much to take. It says, “Adults (12 years or older): Two tablets every four hours; do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 hours.”

Bernie: That’s fine. That’s fine. Where is the prescription medication from my doctor?

Gloria: Here it is. This one has several warnings. It says that it may cause drowsiness or dizziness. It also says, “This drug may impair your ability to drive.”

Bernie: I don’t plan to drive today or any day soon. Now will you please give me my medication?

Gloria: I will as soon as I get this childproof cap off.

Bernie: I may be dead by then!

### 0404 Delegating Work

Anya: I don’t know how I’m going to get all of this work done before I go on vacation.

Estevan: What you need to do is to delegate. Stop being a control freak and get other people to help you with your work.

Anya: I’ve tried to delegate before, but I ended up having to redo the work myself. It was no timesaver at all. It definitely wasn’t worth the trouble.

Estevan: That’s because you have to delegate in the right way. You can’t just assign a project to one of your employees. You have to give them explicit instructions and measurable goals.

Anya: I did that. I gave my employee detailed instructions and she still let me down.

Estevan: I bet you didn’t ask her to report back to you periodically, did you? To get results, you have to tell your employees to give you progress reports. That way, you can make sure she’s on the right track. See what I mean?

Anya: Okay, maybe you’re right. I know one thing. If I don’t get some help soon, I’ll be spending my vacation at my desk!

### 0405 Buying Computer Accessories

Ginger: It’s really nice of you to come with me to buy my computer. This is the desktop I’m thinking about.

Kevin: This is okay, but if I were you, I’d buy a laptop. It’s more versatile. You can travel with it.

Ginger: I’m not sure about getting a laptop. The screen is so small.

Kevin: No problem. You can get a separate monitor. This is a good one. You just need a connector and a cable to hook it up to your laptop. Here’s a monitor stand, too, so you can elevate it if you want to.

Ginger: The speakers on the laptop aren’t very loud.

Kevin: You can get these great speakers. You plug them into your laptop and the sound is amazing.

Ginger: I’m not sure about the battery.

Kevin: It comes with a battery that lasts three to five hours, but you can always buy a spare. Of course, it comes with a power cord, too, so you can just plug it in if your battery runs low.

Ginger: The keyboard is a little cramped, too.

Kevin: That’s what a full-size keyboard is for. You can buy a separate keyboard and mouse and attach them to your laptop. It’ll be just like having a desktop.

Ginger: Then why don’t I just buy a desktop?

Kevin: If you do, you won’t be able to buy all of these great accessories. That’s half the fun of buying a new computer!

### 0406 Participating in Internet Discussion Groups

Dale: I didn’t know you read that forum. What’s your screen name?

Jessie: It’s “jessiegirl,” but I don’t post very often. I like to lurk and follow the different threads, but I prefer to keep a low profile.

Dale: Really? I post all the time. I just put my new web address on my profile, and check this out. It’s my new avatar.

Jessie: That’s cool. I’ve been trying to figure out how to upload a picture for my avatar. Are there instructions in the FAQs?

Dale: I’m not sure, but I can show you how to do it. Have you been following the thread about the presidential campaign?

Jessie: Yeah, I had been...until today.

Dale: Why’s that?

Jessie: I stopped reading when this one guy, “bigman,” started to flame everybody, saying that anyone who didn’t agree with him is an idiot.

Dale: Oh, really?

Jessie: Yeah, he started posting replies, writing in all caps and letting people have it. He quoted people out of context and attacked them. What a jerk!

Dale: Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk.

Jessie: Hey, what did you say your screen name is?

Dale: Never mind.

### 0407 Waiting for a Man or Woman to Call

Lyla: Okay, here’s a hypothetical. You ask a girl for her number, but wait two weeks to call her. What gives?

George: Well, that depends. Why?

Lyla: Well, I met this guy two weeks ago at a party. We spent the entire evening talking and I thought we really hit it off. We had a lot of chemistry and we had a ton of things in common. He asked for my number and he said he’d call me the next day. And then, I didn’t hear hide nor hair of him until yesterday, 10 days after we met. How come?

George: What did he say when he called? What was his pathetic excuse?

Lyla: I didn’t talk to him. I wasn’t home and he left a voicemail message. I haven’t called him back yet.

George: Why don’t you just call him and find out?

Lyla: He just called yesterday and I don’t want to seem desperate.

George: Oh, come on. He probably just lost your number and found it yesterday.

Lyla: That’s possible.

George: Or he had to go out of town and just got back.

Lyla: I suppose.

George: Or maybe he was nervous about calling you and just got up the nerve.

Lyla: Do you really think so?

George: Maybe. Or maybe he’s playing hard to get or he’s just not that into you.

Lyla: Oh.

George: But you won’t know if you don’t call him back.

Lyla: I guess that’s true.

### 0408 Calling Someone You Haven’t Met About a Job

Candace: Hello.

Mehdi: Hello, may I speak to Candace Cho, please?

Candace: Speaking.

Mehdi: Oh, hello Ms. Cho. My name is Mehdi and I’m interested in applying for the job as assistant manager. Your name was listed as the contact person. Am I calling at a bad time?

Candace: No, not at all. I’m the administrative assistant and I’m fielding calls for the person doing the hiring. What can I do for you?

Mehdi: Well, I read the job description and I think I would be a good fit, but I was wondering if there are any special qualifications not mentioned in the description.

Candace: Well, requirements are spelled out in the description, and I don’t have much to add, really. But I do know that the person doing the hiring is looking for someone to start immediately. Can you do that?

Mehdi: Sure, that’s no problem. I’ll be sure to mention that in my cover letter. Thanks.

Candace: If you’ve had experience managing a large staff, be sure to emphasize that in your résumé. Any other questions?

Mehdi: No, no other questions. Thank you very much for your time. You’ve been very helpful.

Candace: Your questions show a lot of initiative. I’m sure you’ll do fine.

Mehdi: Thanks, I really appreciate the vote of confidence.

### 0409 Describing a Musical Performance

Janine: Okay, we need to find one more act for this year’s show. How many more people are waiting to audition?

Calvin: There are two more. Should I call in the first one?

Janine: Yup. Let’s get this over with.
...

Calvin: What did you think of that performance?

Janine: I thought she was flawless. She plays with a lot of passion.

Calvin: Yeah, that’s true, but I wouldn’t call her a virtuoso. The piece she played was pretty rudimentary.

Janine: True enough, but I still think she’s a winner.

Calvin: Let’s hear the next one.
...

Calvin: Well?

Janine: He certainly played with a lot of flair.

Calvin: He has amazing chops, I think. I haven’t seen anyone play with such artistry in a long time.

Janine: Nobody can fault him on mastery of the music, but don’t you think he lacked originality and expressiveness?

Calvin: No, I don’t. I think he’s a winner.

Janine: It’s clear that it’s a stalemate. I want the first performer and you want the second. What should we do?

Calvin: I think we should duke it out and the winner gets his or her choice.

Janine: I have a better idea. We add them both to the bill.

Calvin: That’s brilliant! That’s why they pay you the big bucks.

Janine: I would be flattered if we weren’t all volunteers!

### 0410 Being Evasive

Olivia: Dad, can I ask you a question?

Dad: You just did.

Olivia: I mean, can I ask you another question?

Dad: Ask away.

Olivia: Where do babies come from?

Dad: What? Where did you come up with that one?

Olivia: I don’t know.

Dad: Let me tell you. That’s for grown-ups to know. You’re just a pipsqueak. You mind your own business and I’ll tell you when you’re a little older.

Olivia: Why can’t you tell me now?

Dad: No comment.

Olivia: Dad, what does no comment mean?

Dad: That’s confidential.

Olivia: Why is it confidential?

Dad: That’s personal.

Olivia: Dad, just tell me.

Dad: Never you mind.

Olivia: But I want to know!

Dad: And I want to know why I can’t get some peace and quiet in this house.

Olivia: Oh, Dad.

Dad: Don’t “oh, Dad” me. Just wait and see. You’ll get all the answers you want when you’re older.

Olivia: But Dad, I want to know now. Where do babies come from?

Dad: I’m out of answers. Go ask your mother.

Olivia: I did. Mom said to ask you.

### 0411 Eating Junk Food

Frank: Hand me that bag of potato chips.

Katie: Here. You mean you’re still hungry after two burgers and French fries?

Frank: Yeah, I am. I’m a growing boy. Where’s the popcorn?

Katie: I can’t believe we’re eating all of this junk food. I’m supposed to be watching what I eat.

Frank: Forget about it. Who can watch a football game without stuffing their faces? It’s an American tradition.

Katie: Where did you get those candy bars?

Frank: Some kids were selling them door-to-door and I thought it was my duty to buy some.

Katie: It was your duty to buy 10 candy bars?!

Frank: What can I say? I’m a softy.

Katie: I’m getting another soda. Do you want one?

Frank: No, thanks. But while you’re up, can you hand me the phone?

Katie: Sure, why?

Frank: I’m ordering a pizza.

### 0412 Corporate Spying

Joachim: I’m really having second thoughts about hiring a firm to do corporate spying for us. I don’t want to do anything that’s ethically questionable.

Dawn: We have no choice but to do it. All of our competitors conduct corporate espionage.

Joachim: I can understand spying on our competitors, but I draw the line at having us snoop on our own employees.

Dawn: We wouldn’t unless our backs were against the wall. I know you’re thinking about Hewer Placket hiring investigators to find a leak in their company. I’m sure it was a hard decision for them, but they couldn’t allow anyone in their own company to leak trade secrets.

Joachim: True, it was necessary, but I don’t like being deceptive with our own employees. I won’t allow wiretaps or any invasion of privacy.

Dawn: Our first priority would be damage control, not privacy. In any case, we’re not making a decision to spy within the company right now. We’re only after our rival’s information. The investigators we’re hiring know the difference between legal and illegal spying. They’ll schmooze at trade shows, scour legal records, and do other things like that. They’ll know where to draw the line.

Joachim: I hope you’re right. I don’t want to end up on the front page of the Times!

### 0413 Talking About Intelligence

Andre: Mom, I can’t believe I got stuck with Matt as my lab partner in school.

Josephine: Matt? Do I know Matt?

Andre: He lives down the street. He’s Mr. and Mrs. Kemp’s son. He’s a total airhead.

Josephine: Oh, I remember him. He was at your birthday party.

Andre: Yeah, when I was nine years old! That guy is so dense!

Josephine: Matt was always considered a gifted child. He seemed bright and perceptive, and his parents thought he’d go far.

Andre: If you ask me, he’s not all there. Every time I look over at him in class, he’s staring off into space. He doesn’t seem like the kind who’s very quick on the uptake.

Josephine: You know, some very smart people can seem spacey to the rest of us. Maybe he’s just thinking when he stares off into space.

Andre: Maybe. All I know is that my science grade is riding on how we do in the lab, so I hope he shapes up.

Josephine: I’m sure he will. And even if he doesn’t, you’re clever enough to still do well in the class.

Andre: Thanks, Mom, but I wouldn’t bet on it!

### 0414 Common Traffic Signs

Ben: Why are you squinting like that?

Lauren: I left my glasses at the office.

Ben: You mean you can’t see?!

Lauren: I can see pretty well. What was that yellow sign we just passed?

Ben: It said, “Dead End.” Stop! Turn around.

Lauren: I can’t. That sign says, “No U-turn.”

Ben: Okay, but we can’t keep going. Those signs say, “Do Not Enter” and “One Way.”

Lauren: Okay, fine. I’ll just pull off the road and you can drive.

Ben: You can’t. That sign says, “No Stopping.” Hey, you just made an illegal U-turn!

Lauren: What else could I do? Anyway, we’re back on track now.

Ben: Watch out for those speed bumps! You really are blind without your glasses. You’re going too fast. According to that sign, this is a school crossing zone. The posted speed limit is 25 miles per hour.

Lauren: That’s only true when the lights are flashing. Is that a “Detour” sign?

Ben: I can’t believe it. Will I never get home?

### 0415 Being Clean and Dirty

Ray: My mother is coming for a visit, which means we need to do some spring cleaning this weekend.

Debra: I’ll get the duster, if you’ll get the broom.

Ray: I’m serious. You know how nit-picky my mother is and I want our house to be neat and tidy.

Debra: Fine, fine, I understand. You don’t want her to know we live in a pigsty.

Ray: I’m not saying we live in a pigsty, but the house is a little messy and dusty. It wouldn’t hurt to straighten up a little bit, that’s all.

Debra: I’m willing to pitch in, but I’m not going to spend the entire weekend slaving away to get this house spotless. Your mother won’t love you any less if you’re not a neat freak.

Ray: You don’t know my mother very well.

Debra: I know her well enough. I don’t want to spoil her fun. If she can’t complain about our dirty house, what will she complain about?

### 0416 Finding a Niche in Business

Hello, business students. I’m here today at your professor’s request to talk to you about the importance of finding your own niche in business. Conventional wisdom says that people in business need to diversify their skill sets so that they can be the most flexible in whatever field they decide to enter. While there is some truth to this, that’s only half of the picture.

Those who diversify too much run the risk of being a jack of all trades and master of none. Not having a focused set of skills may also be seen as indecisive from the standpoint of a potential employer, and your application may fall by the wayside as a result. Having a niche will help you stand out in the crowd.

In business, it’s a balancing act between having the general skills that any company will want, and also possessing specialized skills that will make you the go-to person in your organization. Keep this in mind and you’ll go far.

### 0417 Getting Travel Documents

Joyce: We need to apply for our passports now if we want to have them in time for our trip to McQuillanland.

Steven: I have a passport.

Joyce: Yes, but it expired last year. You need to renew it before you can get a visa. McQuillanland requires a visa and vaccinations before they’ll allow entry into the country.

Steven: Okay, okay, where is the application? I thought U.S. citizens could travel freely in McQuillanland.

Joyce: That used to be true, but their policies have changed. We also need to bring our applications to their consulate in person, with all of the supporting documents.

Steven: Fine. The application asks which visa classification we’re applying for. Should I check student or tourist?

Joyce: Even though we’re taking a language course while we’re there, we’re asking for a tourist visa. We can stay for three months on a tourist visa.

Steven: What are they going to do if we overstay our visa, deport us?

Joyce: Yes they will, and you don’t want to deal with the McQuillanland authorities. They’re not known for being kind to lawbreakers.

Steven: Those McQuillanlanders are my kind of people.

### 0418 Getting Bad Service

Buck: I’m never going to that coffee house again!

Star: Why? What happened?

Buck: It’s the third time in a week that I’ve had lousy service. I don’t expect five-star treatment, but I do expect service industry employees to be at least civil.

Star: What happened this time?

Buck: I walked in and went up to the counter to place my order. The woman working there was talking to her friend, another customer. I stood there, clearly needing to be waited on and she couldn’t have cared less.

Star: You mean she didn’t even acknowledge you?

Buck: Are you kidding? She didn’t stop talking for one second. When she finally took a breath, I told her my order. She gave me a dirty look and finally turned around to get my coffee. She practically threw it at me!

Star: Well, maybe she was having a bad day. At least you got your coffee.

Buck: I got a cup of coffee, but not the kind I ordered. When I realized it, I went back to the counter and she was still talking to her friend. I interrupted her and told her that I got the wrong order. She had the chutzpah to try to tell me that I had made a mistake in telling her my order. Not only did she not take responsibility for her mistake, she tried to tell me that it was my fault!

Star: That’s really infuriating. What are you going to do?

Buck: One good thing about her talking with her friend for so long is that I got her name. I’ll be calling the manager to complain.

Star: Aren’t you overreacting?

Buck: No, I’m not. She’s lucky I didn’t pour the coffee over her head!

### 0419 Planting a Garden

Joni: Smell that!

Giuseppe: Smell what?

Joni: Smell that fresh air. Aren’t you glad I got you to help me plant this garden? We’re going to have so much fun today.

Giuseppe: Uh huh. I’m glad to help, but I don’t exactly have a green thumb.

Joni: That’s okay. As long as you can tell a shovel from a lawn mower, you’ll be fine. Let’s start by moving these pots next to the bushes.

Giuseppe: Okay, your wish is my command.

Joni: Oh, this bag of fertilizer is so heavy.

Giuseppe: Let me get that.

Joni: Thanks. I didn’t know we had so many large bags of seeds, too.

Giuseppe: Do you want me to help you with those?

Joni: Thanks a lot. I’ll also need someone to help me hoe this soil.

Giuseppe: I guess I could do that.

Joni: And how am I going to pull all of these weeds?

Giuseppe: Honestly, I think we need reinforcements.

Joni: Good idea. You start working and I’ll go see if I can round up more help. [She leaves.]

Giuseppe: I start working while she leaves? Hmm…I think she just pulled a fast one on me.

### 0420 Workplace Safety

Lon: What’s this?

Abigail: It’s a memo about a safety inspection scheduled for next week.

Lon: A safety inspection? How are we ever going to pass a safety inspection?

Abigail: What do you mean? This isn’t an unsafe workplace. We’ve had a good record. None of our employees have had on-the-job injuries this year and we’ve never had a fatality. I don’t understand why you’re so worried.

Lon: From what I’ve heard, the inspectors don’t just look at injury rates. They look for the smallest hazard that may be remotely dangerous. If we get cited, we may be shut down.

Abigail: With all due respect, I don’t think that’s how it works. Yes, the inspector will look at our work environment and our gear and machinery to make sure there are no hazards or toxic substances.

Lon: That’s what I’m worried about.

Abigail: But, if they find a violation, we’ll get a chance to fix the problem. They won’t shut us down without giving us a chance to comply with their safety standards.

Lon: I sure hope you’re right.

Abigail: Me, too. We’ll know after next week’s inspection.

### 0421 Internet Dating

Kevin: I know a lot of people are doing it, but I’m not so sure about trying an Internet dating service.

Eun: What do you have to lose? This website says that it screens all of its members. Let’s look at some of the profiles.

Kevin: All right. We have to select the criteria for a search. Let’s see...gender – “female”; location – “Los Angeles”; age range – “26 to 35.”

Eun: Wow, you got 243 hits. I think you’d better narrow down the search criteria.

Kevin: Okay, I’ll search for people who live within a 50-mile radius. That gives us 72 hits.

Eun: Click on that one. Let’s see. This woman is 29 and she’s an accountant. She’s very pretty.

Kevin: Do you think people would upload any photos that weren’t flattering?

Eun: Still, I think she’s promising, don’t you? Anyway, who doesn’t tell a few white lies in their dating profile? It’s not like you’re misrepresenting yourself. If you sign up for a trial membership, you’ll have to do the same thing.

Kevin: Will I? What will I need to lie about?

Eun: Nothing, nothing. You’re perfect just the way you are.

### 0422 Shopping for Underwear

Kerry: We’re almost done with the shopping. We just need some underwear for you and some unmentionables for me.

Russell: It’s perfectly acceptable for women to buy men’s underwear, but do I have to go into the lingerie store? All of the women in the store laugh at me.

Kerry: No, they don’t. I just need a few things. Here we are. Okay, I need a new bra with underwire, and I need a strapless one, too. Do you see any in a B cup?

Russell: I’m not helping you look. I’m standing over here where nobody can see me.

Kerry: Fine. Let’s see, I need some panties and a slip, too. Oh, these pantyhose are on sale.

Russell: Can you please hurry up? That woman over there is snickering.

Kerry: She’s only laughing because you look so uncomfortable. Okay, I’m done. Let’s go get your underwear.

Russell: Thank God! I just need some new boxers with a comfortable waistband and a button fly.

Kerry: I thought you liked the boxer briefs I bought before, you know, the seamless ones.

Russell: I tried them, but they were too small. I think I’d actually like to try some regular briefs. Here are some over here.

Kerry: You’d better look again. Those are g-strings. If you insist on buying those, it’ll be my turn to hide.

### 0423 Reading Food Labels

I never read food labels until I started going out with Wendy. She’s studying to be a nutritionist. When we go grocery shopping, she reads every label.

________

Wendy: You’re not buying that, are you?

Ichirou: Well, I was thinking about it. Why?

Wendy: Each serving size has 30 grams of fat, and 10 of those are trans fat. The sodium level is through the roof, and it’s full of carbohydrates. Do you really want to put that in your body?

Ichirou: Um, I guess not.

Wendy: What are these cookies doing in the basket?

Ichirou: Those are my favorite. I always get them. I got the low-fat kind, see?

Wendy: Even so, they’re full of calories. They may be reduced fat, but they’re not low fat. You don’t eat this kind of cereal do you?

Ichirou: Yeah, I do.

Wendy: Look at the percent daily values. You get nearly no nutrients and no dietary fiber, and it’s full of sugar.

________

I really like Wendy, but I’m not sure how long I can take this. She has the best of intentions, but will my stomach ever forgive me if I keep going out with her? That’s the question.

### 0424 Being in Debt

Chang: I don’t mean to be nosey, but all of those bills are red or pink. Are you behind on all of those bills?

Ilya: I am, but it’s no big deal. I can catch up on them next month.

Chang: You know that being late on bills is bad for your credit score, right? You also have to pay exorbitant interest if you have credit card debt.

Ilya: Don’t worry about it. Everything will be fine.

Chang: I’m only speaking from experience. When I first started working, I had a loan that I defaulted on and I ran up my credit cards. I had to borrow money from my family and friends to pay my bills. I was so desperate at one point, I even went to see a loan shark.

Ilya: Did he lend you money?

Chang: I decided against borrowing money from him after talking to my brother about it. With his help, I found a good credit counselor and got my finances under control. My two main creditors agreed to defer payment for a couple of months, but not before I sold my car and most of what I owned to raise money.

Ilya: Maybe I can do that.

Chang: Do what?

Ilya: Work with a credit counselor so I don’t have to pay my bills.

Chang: You’ve got it all wrong. It took me years to pay off those bills. I just didn’t have debt collectors calling me at all hours of the day, that’s all. A little advice: A little restraint now will save you a lot of pain.

Ilya: Okay, okay. I got the message. Remind me never to pay my bills in front of you again!

### 0425 Serving Drinks and Cocktails

Spencer: I’m practicing making drinks for the party tonight. Do you want to try one?

Heidi: You’re the bartender? I didn’t know you knew how to mix drinks.

Spencer: I can hold my own. Okay, name it and I’ll make it – any mixed drink or cocktail.

Heidi: Okay, I’ll have a Screwdriver.

Spencer: A Screwdriver? Hmm…what’s in that?

Heidi: Aren’t you supposed to know, Mr. Bartender?

Spencer: I’ve never made one of those before, that’s all. Try something else.

Heidi: How about a Bloody Mary?

Spencer: A Bloody Mary, a Bloody Mary…do you want that on the rocks?

Heidi: Sure, that’ll be great.

Spencer: Here you are – a Bloody Mary in a highball. Enjoy!

Heidi: [Makes a gagging sound] This doesn’t taste like a Bloody Mary. It tastes like you poured an entire bottle of alcohol into this.

Spencer: Oh, come on. It’s not that bad. Here, I’ll add a little soda, and oh, I forgot the garnish.

Heidi: I don’t think that’s going to help. Can I give you some advice? Stick to shots and drinks served straight up.

Spencer: Ah, don’t lose faith in me. Let me make you one more drink.

Heidi: Okay, but make it virgin. My mouth is still on fire from the last one.

### 0426 Talking About Product Quality

Brenda: It’s fun shopping for a new cell phone, don’t you think?

Yoji: Sure, but I just need one with the bare basics.

Brenda: Not me. I want one that’s top-of-the-line. My old phone was cheap and flimsy, and it started acting up after only a few months.

Yoji: I want something that’s good quality, but I don’t think I should have to pay top dollar for it, especially since I don’t need the bells and whistles.

Brenda: The bells and whistles are the best part!

Yoji: I like this one. It seems sturdy and it should last me for years.

Brenda: That is one ugly phone!

Yoji: I don’t care about its looks. I just want something functional and that won’t fall apart.

Brenda: I’m not arguing for style over substance, but that phone is hideous.

Yoji: I’ll get over it.

Brenda: Yes, but I’m not sure I will!

### 0427 Planning a Protest

Becky: I want to thank all of you for coming today. I think we all agree that we need to organize a protest…

Pedro: Hold on, Becky. We all want to voice our opinion that we oppose what is going on here, but I’m not sure a protest is the answer.

Becky: With all due respect, Pedro, I think a rally is the best way to do that.

Pedro: That may be, but I think we need to consider a few things first. Taking to the streets means coordinating a lot of people. That means getting them to show up, to march, and to hold up signs. I’m not sure we have enough time to pull it all off.

Becky: Don’t get me wrong. I’m not in favor of doing anything half-assed. If we decide to protest, we want to do it right so that we get a lot of media coverage. I’m confident that we have enough people and time to get it all done.

Pedro: Okay, but another thing we should be ready for is a counter protest. The other side isn’t going to take things lying down.

Becky: You’re right, and we’ll take that into consideration. Is there any more discussion before we start on the planning? No? Okay, let’s get down to business.

### 0428 Getting a Dream Job

Tandia: Do you want these want ads after I’m finished with them?

Hank: No, I’m not going to find my dream job in the classifieds. I’m going to have to get more creative with my job search.

Tandia: What are you looking for?

Hank: I want a job that’s rewarding and fast-paced, and with good growth potential, but all I see are dead-end jobs.

Tandia: I know what you mean. I’m looking for something that’s challenging, but also with flexible work hours. All of my friends have great jobs. Why can’t I land one of them?

Hank: Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, we need a better game plan.

Tandia: What do you have in mind?

Hank: I’m not sure, but we need to get noticed.

Tandia: Why don’t you take out a billboard? That should get you noticed.

Hank: Hey, that’s really thinking out of the box.

Tandia: I was joking!

Hank: I’m not. That’s an inspired idea. Now what should we put on the billboard?

Tandia: You’re crazy!

### 0429 Giving Awards and Congratulations

Part of my job as school principal is to hand out awards and scholarships to students. We recently had a ceremony to do just that.

.....

Principal: Miguel, I want to commend you for your work this year and congratulate you for winning the science award. It is well deserved.

The recipient of this year’s community service award is Monique for her outstanding achievements. My heartiest congratulations to you, Monique.

I am also very proud of another one of our students, Yugo, who has been awarded the ESL Podcast award. This prestigious award honors the achievements of outstanding students. Yugo, a job well done.

Finally, we are also honoring one of our teachers today. For her dedication to her students and to the school, we are recognizing the achievements of Ms. Niehbur. I cannot imagine a more deserving teacher. Please accept my sincere congratulations.

### 0430 Talking About Books

Maggie: What did you think of the book you started last week?

Kurt: Oh, I liked it well enough.

Maggie: Wow, that’s a glowing recommendation.

Kurt: Well, it started off with a bang and the suspense in the first half was great. I couldn’t put it down. Then, the pace changed in the second half and it was an effort to finish it.

Maggie: Really? I read it a few months ago and I loved it. I thought the characterization was really good. I could really relate to the two main characters.

Kurt: Yeah, that’s true enough, but the plot dragged, don’t you think? The author just couldn’t pull it off and the ending was laughable.

Maggie: I really liked the ending! I can’t wait for the sequel.

Kurt: Well, that makes one of us.

### 0431 Health in Developing Countries

Silvia: What are you watching?

Hermann: I’m watching a show about the health problems in developing countries.

Silvia: Don’t we have enough healthcare problems here, in this country?

Hermann: We do, but there are countries that have a lot more acute problems than we do.

Silvia: Oh, those kids are so cute.

Hermann: Yeah, but a lot of them are going to die of malnutrition and infectious diseases, things that are preventable.

Silvia: I thought the biggest problem was the spread of AIDS and HIV.

Hermann: Those are huge problems, no question about it, but a lot of people die of other preventable diseases, too, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and measles. Believe it or not, we’ve had immunizations for measles for over 40 years!

Silvia: That’s terrible. I can see why you’re studying medicine. I wish I could be a doctor.

Hermann: You could, but first, you’ll need to get over your fear of blood.

### 0432 Using the Copier

Tim: Damn it!

Pam: What’s the matter?

Tim: It’s this copier. My original didn’t come out of the feeder and there’s a paper jam.

Pam: Let me see if I can clear it. This machine is really temperamental.

Tim: Tell me about it.

Pam: Okay, I found your original, but it’s stuck. I’m afraid if I pull too hard, it’ll tear.

Tim: Let me try. I got it! Okay, I need to shrink the first page and adjust the contrast so that it’s more readable. Then I need to enlarge the second page. After that, I need to make 20 collated copies.

Pam: Oh, oh, don’t look now, but the toner light is on. You’ll need to put in a new cartridge.

Tim: Is there anything else that can go wrong with this stupid copier?!

Pam: Don’t tempt fate. It could be worse. The whole thing could break down!

### 0433 Describing People’s Voices

Adriana: Shhh, I’m trying to listen to the radio.

Ralph: How can you listen to that radio station? All of their deejays have such funny voices.

Adriana: That’s precisely why I like it. Take this guy, Kevin. He has a deep, husky voice that I find really sexy.

Ralph: This guy? His voice is so monotone that it lulls me to sleep every time I hear it.

Adriana: Well, if you don’t like his voice, how about his sidekick, Lisa May? Her voice is music to my ears.

Ralph: She has a nice lilt in her voice, but it’s so high-pitched and squeaky. It can really be grating to listen to her for more than a few minutes.

Adriana: Okay, if you don’t like their voices, what kind of voices do you like?

Ralph: I like a gravelly voice, speaking softly and saying...

Adriana: I’m not talking about your fantasies. I don’t want to know anything about those!

### 0434 Using Coupons and Rebates

Torsten: What are you doing, clipping coupons? That’s a waste of time.

Cindy: You can think what you like, but these days, we have to cut corners wherever we can.

Torsten: No one actually saves much money using coupons.

Cindy: That’s what you think. The last time I went to the grocery store, I saved over $20 just by using coupons.

Torsten: How can you keep track of all of the expiration dates and the terms and conditions? It’s not worth the trouble.

Cindy: Do you feel that way about rebate offers, too? A month ago, I bought our new TV and saved 20 percent. And yesterday, I bought a pack of DVDs for just $2.

Torsten: Are you putting me on? A pack of DVDs for $2?

Cindy: Yeah, it was a great offer, but it was only for one day. I had to cut out the UPC code, fill out a form, and mail it in with the receipt to the manufacturer. Then, I sent a copy of the receipt to the retailer and got another discount. That’s how I got the DVDs for next to nothing.

Torsten: You might save money with rebates, but you have to sit around forever waiting for the rebate check.

Cindy: It’s true that the turnaround is often 8-10 weeks, but some of the offers are worth the wait.

Torsten: Do what you like, but I’m too busy to mess around with coupons and rebates.

Cindy: That’s why you married a penny-pincher. If I left it up to you, we’d be in the poorhouse by now!

### 0435 Describing Aches and Pains

Nivia: Why are you walking funny?

Michael: Oh, I pulled a muscle in my right leg while playing with my kids last weekend. It’s hard to walk without feeling a twinge of pain.

Nivia: I’m sorry to hear that. Why are you sitting in that awkward position?

Michael: I strained my back while exercising. Initially, I felt a sharp pain and I thought it was something serious, but it doesn’t hurt much now. There’s just a dull pain when I sit up straight. That’s why I’m sitting like this, leaning to the side.

Nivia: That’s too bad. Why are you holding your arms that way?

Michael: I got up in the middle of the night last night to go to the bathroom and bumped into the door. I got a huge bruise on my arm. It feels better if I hold it over my head.

Nivia: Why are you shaking your fingers that way?

Michael: I helped my daughter finish her science project for school. I – I mean we – glued over 100 wooden sticks together. My fingers are really sore and stiff, and they won’t stop throbbing.

Nivia: I’m afraid to ask you any more questions. I don’t think any man could survive any more injuries than what you already have!

### 0436 Dealing With an Angry Client

Shawna: Hello, Shawna Davis.

Monty: Hello, Shawna. This is Monty Lofti at BMC. I need to talk to you about our ad that ran in your newspaper yesterday.

Shawna: Sure, Monty. Was there a problem?

Monty: Yes, there certainly was a problem. Instead of the picture of our model, there was a picture of a dog!

Shawna: That’s awful! I wasn’t aware of the substitution. On behalf of the newspaper, I sincerely apologize for the error.

Monty: I don’t think you understand the magnitude of the problem. Our slogan is: “Look in the mirror and this could be you!” Now do you get it? Our store is a laughingstock!

Shawna: I can’t tell you how sorry we are for this egregious mistake. We will certainly run a correction in tomorrow’s paper, and we will run a corrected version of your ad. That’s the least we can do. Is there anything else we can do to make amends for our mistake?

Monty: Yes, there is. I’d like the person responsible to be called on the mat for this.

Shawna: Rest assured. We take this matter very seriously. We’ll find out who is responsible and heads will roll.

Monty: Good. That’s what I wanted to hear.

### 0437 Having a Best Friend

Lucy: I’m so excited! My friend, Marlene, is coming to town for a visit.

Buddy: Have I met Marlene?

Lucy: No, I don’t think so. We grew up together and we were always joined at the hip.

Buddy: When I was little, I had a friend like that. We were blood brothers.

Lucy: Yeah, Marlene and I did everything together and she was my confidant about everything.

Buddy: She sounds like a great friend.

Lucy: Yeah, she always had my back and I could always count on her to give it to me straight.

Buddy: A friend like that is hard to come by. Are you still close?

Lucy: Not as close as I’d like. We live in different cities and it’s hard to keep up with what’s happening in each other’s lives.

Buddy: I can see that. Does she know you’re getting married?

Lucy: No, I wanted to break the news to her face-to-face.

Buddy: Why? I would have thought you’d want to tell her the good news right away.

Lucy: Well, I want her to be my maid of honor and I’m not sure how she’ll react to the dress she’ll have to wear.

Buddy: Is it that bad?

Lucy: My future mother-in-law picked it out and I can’t say “no.” Here’s a picture of it.

Buddy: Well, I’m glad she’s such a good friend, because if anything can break up a friendship, it’s that dress.

### 0438 Renting an Apartment

Heather: Hi, are you the apartment manager? I saw the vacancy sign outside and I’m looking for an apartment.

Sam: Yes, I’m Sam. We have one unit available right now. When are you looking to move in?

Heather: The lease on my apartment is up soon, so I’d like to move in the first of the month.

Sam: Okay, follow me and let me show you the unit. Each unit gets one parking space in the garage, and there are laundry facilities on the first floor. The landlord pays for the gas, but the tenant pays for all other utilities. Here’s the unit. Take a look around.

Heather: Oh, this is nice. Is this a furnished unit?

Sam: It can be furnished or unfurnished, your choice. Since it’s an end unit, there’s only one common wall.

Heather: This apartment is exactly what I’m looking for. How much is the rent?

Sam: It’s $900 a month and we require a 12-month lease. To move in, you’ll need to have the first and last month’s rent, plus a security deposit.

Heather: How much is the security deposit?

Sam: It’s $450.

Heather: Okay, I’ll think it over and get back to you. Thanks for your time.

Sam: These units go fast, so if you’re interested, I suggest that you jump on it.

Heather: Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind.

### 0439 Talking about Censorship

The school that my daughter attends is trying to decide whether or not to ban certain books, which some parents think are inappropriate. The school called a parents meeting to talk over the issue.

At the meeting, one woman said: “The books on this list are obscene! I don’t want my children reading that filth!”

Another parent responded: “That’s absurd! Haven’t you ever heard of free speech? Banning books violates everything we Americans believe in.”

Another parent said: “I don’t like the way this book portrays history. To me, it’s morally objectionable.”

Still another parent complained: “There is too much graphic violence in these books and I won’t allow my son to be exposed to it.”

A parent stood up and yelled: “People who want to ban books are fear mongering. They don’t give our kids enough credit.”

The meeting turned into a shouting match. If you ask me, I’m very glad that none of the students were at this meeting. They would be learning an important lesson, but not one that any parent would want!

### 0440 Being a Self-Made Man/Woman

Edgar: What a crock!

Ann: What is it?

Edgar: I’m reading an article about successful business people who were self-made men and women. I don’t believe a word of it.

Ann: What don’t you believe?

Edgar: These people didn’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps. They were all born with silver spoons in their mouths.

Ann: Not all successful people were born into money and privilege.

Edgar: That’s true, but it gets me riled up when people who grew up at the country club claim to have had humble beginnings.

Ann: Just because some people were born with a leg up doesn’t mean they didn’t work hard to get where they are.

Edgar: Where would that hard work have gotten them if they didn’t have backers with deep pockets, or if they didn’t know people in high places? I know plenty of hard-working people who aren’t hobnobbing with the rich and famous.

Ann: That’s true enough. Who needs the rich and famous? I’ll take my hard-working man over any of them any day.

Edgar: That’s why I married you – a woman with beauty and brains!

### 0441 Preparing Food for Cooking

Marissa: How can I help?

Juan Carlos: Um...why don’t you iron the tablecloth and set the table?

Marissa: I already did that. I want to help with the cooking.

Juan Carlos: Okay, you can scrub these potatoes, peel the carrots, and rinse these grapes.

Marissa: All right, I’ll do that, but I think you’re just giving me the scut work. I want to do some real cooking.

Juan Carlos: Well okay, I guess you could cut up this chicken and then chop these vegetables. After that, you can sauté the vegetables in this pan.

Marissa: Great! Now, how do you sauté? I’ve never done it before.

Juan Carlos: What?! Forget it. You can steam the vegetables instead.

Marissa: Okay, just show me how.

Juan Carlos: Never mind. Here, just beat these eggs and slice these onions. When you’re done, you can toss that salad.

Marissa: But I want to whip up some gourmet dishes. When can I cook?

Juan Carlos: That’s a good question. Ask me again when you’ve learned how!

### 0442 Flying on Low-Cost Airlines

Sue: I just made airline reservations for our trip. Do you want to look over the itinerary before I purchase the tickets?

Alex: Which airline is it?

Sue: It’s McTse Air.

Alex: Oh, no, I don’t want to fly on that low-cost airline! We don’t get assigned seats and all of the passengers rush the gate when boarding begins. I hate that!

Sue: Not having assigned seats is a small price to pay for low fares. The service may be stripped down, but I don’t think the experience is that bad.

Alex: I don’t mind a no-frills flight, but I don’t want to fly out of some tiny airport that’s an hour away. Which airport would we be departing from?

Sue: It’s the Burbank Airport. Yes, I know it’s less convenient to fly out of a secondary airport, but I don’t see what the big deal is.

Alex: Okay, hand it over. I’m taking over the planning for our vacation. I’m not willing to sacrifice comfort to save a few bucks.

Sue: Fine, be my guest.

### 0443 Having a Slumber Party

Russ: Mom says you’re having a slumber party next Saturday.

Irene: I’m just having a few friends over for a sleepover and it’s none of your business.

Russ: Don’t be like that. How many people did you invite?

Irene: I’m not telling you anything. I know what you’re thinking. You want to pull pranks on us.

Russ: No, I don’t. I just want to know how many giggling girls in sleeping bags I’ll have to step over to get to the kitchen.

Irene: You’re not going to get anything out of me. I can see right through you.

Russ: Are you going to wear your pajamas with feet?

Irene: Don’t be stupid! I haven’t worn those since I was six!

Russ: Can I be part of the pillow fight?

Irene: No way! You’re not invited!

Russ: But you’re going to stay up all night and watch movies, aren’t you? I want to do that, too.

Irene: You’d better stop teasing me or I’m going to tell Mom.

Russ: I’m not doing anything. I’m only trying to help you plan your party.

Irene: Right! You want to help me? It’s more like you want to wreck my party.

Russ: Ah, you’ve hurt my feelings.

Irene: I doubt it. Now leave me alone!

### 0444 Planning for Retirement

Paulina: Did you get your social security statement? I just got mine in the mail. If I keep working at this rate for the next 20 years, between Social Security and my savings, I should be sitting pretty for retirement.

Carlos: Yeah, I should be okay when I retire, too. I’ve been contributing to a 401(k) through my work for years, and my company gives a matching contribution.

Paulina: Really? I never bothered with a 401(k).

Carlos: A 401(k) really adds up over time. I also have an IRA, which is tax-deferred, and I have my money in a portfolio that is split between stocks and bonds. All of these investments are for the long haul, of course. How about you? What’s your retirement plan?

Paulina: I have money stashed away in a nice little nest egg.

Carlos: Where do you have your money invested?

Paulina: It’s safe and sound, don’t you worry.

Carlos: [Laughs] You make it sound like you have it stashed under your mattress.

Paulina: A mattress is a very safe place for your money!

### 0445 Problems with Drugs and Medical Devices

Suzanne: Don’t take that! I’m reading an article in the newspaper about all of the drugs and medical devices that have been recalled in the past year and you wouldn’t believe how long this list is.

Abdul: I’m just taking something for my headache. I’m sure this medicine is fine.

Suzanne: Don’t be so sure. I’m just reading about this drug that was contaminated and before it was recalled, it caused 13 deaths.

Abdul: Contaminated drugs are one in a million. Now can I take my medicine?

Suzanne: Listen to this. Over 400 people had terrible side effects before this drug was recalled, and a drug recalled six months ago causes birth defects. Here’s a medical device for people with heart problems that’s defective and eight people died as a result.

Abdul: Okay, I’ve heard enough.

Suzanne: No, wait, there’s more. You’ve got to see this list of alerts that the government issued warning people against over-the-counter drugs like the one you’re about to take. You’d better check to see if it’s on this list.

Abdul: Don’t be ridiculous. I’ve been taking this for months. If there were something wrong with it, don’t you think the pharmaceutical company would have taken out full-page ads in the papers?

Suzanne: I doubt it. Do you think they want to encourage litigation?

Abdul: Here, you check it against that list. If you find it on there, you can say you’ve saved my life!

### 0446 Going to a Home Improvement Store

Paige: I think we can get everything we need to fix up the house in one trip. What do you think?

Vern: We can try. It seems like everybody had the same thought when they woke up this morning: Go to the home improvement store!

Paige: Yeah, it’s a little crowded, but I still think we can get all we need today.

Vern: To do that, I think we need to split up. Let’s look at our list and divvy it up.

Paige: Okay, we need to get some wiring to install the new lights. I’ll go to the electrical department for that.

Vern: All right. We need lumber for the new fence, so I’ll go to the building materials department.

Paige: What about the pipes and fixtures we need for the bathroom? Can you go to the plumbing department for those, while I go to the hardware department for the tools?

Vern: Okay, I can do that, but aren’t you feeling tired already? I know I am.

Paige: Come on. How are we supposed to be weekend warriors if we can’t even do some simple shopping? We’ll meet in the garden department afterwards, okay?

Vern: Whatever you say.

Paige: Ready, set, go!

### 0447 Heating and Cooling a Home

Carla: It’s freezing in here! Why is the air conditioner on?

Trent: I just finished exercising and I’m sweating like a pig.

Carla: That’s no reason to turn the A/C on full blast! I’m cold. I’m turning on the heat for a little while.

Trent: Are you crazy? It’s 70 degrees outside!

Carla: I’m no crazier than you are. How come you can turn on the A/C and I can’t turn on the heat?

Trent: I only turned on the A/C because it’s so humid outside, and it was taking a long time for me to cool down. If you’re cold, just open the windows and doors, and we’ll get some ventilation in here. It’ll heat up again pretty quickly.

Carla: What should I do in the meantime? Put on my winter coat or crawl under the covers?

Trent: Go sit outside. I’ll get myself a glass of iced tea and I’ll get you a cup of hot tea. How does that sound?

Carla: Leave it to you to come up with the best idea of the day!

### 0448 Making Business Contacts

Phan: Hi, Montel. Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

Montel: It’s my pleasure.

Phan: Since I’m new here, I was hoping you might be willing to give me some pointers on how to get new clients. To be honest, I’ve never been on this side of the fence before and I’m a little out of my comfort zone.

Montel: Oh, sure, I’m glad to give you as much help as I can. Getting clients is a bit of an art, but the key is building relationships.

Phan: What do you mean?

Montel: Most of my clients come to me through networking. I get referrals from people who know me and know my track record.

Phan: Really? I was thinking that I needed to send out some direct mail or do some cold calling.

Montel: You may need to do that to start, but if I were you, I’d also spend time making connections in the business community. Go where you think business prospects may be. To woo new clients, you need to meet them first.

Phan: How do I find out where they’ll be?

Montel: Again, you make contacts. You’ve made the first step today by getting in touch with me. I’m going to a reception tonight and it will be a who’s who of the business community. Do you want to go?

Phan: Really? You’d let me tag along?

Montel: Sure, but there’s a quid pro quo. In the future, if you get invited to something like this, you invite me to go along.

Phan: That’s more than fair. I think I just got my first lesson in making business connections.

### 0449 Using an Instruction Manual

Aretha: Oh, here’s the instruction manual. I’ll read you the section on “getting started.”

Carl: No, you don’t need to do that. I know how to do the installation.

Aretha: But don’t you want to hear about the different functions and specifications?

Carl: There’ll be time for that after everything is hooked up and we program the machine.

Aretha: Okay, but the manual says that you shouldn’t plug in the power supply until you’re done with the installation.

Carl: I won’t. Hmm…where is the port for this cord?

Aretha: Do you want me to look it up in the manual? There’s a troubleshooting section.

Carl: No, I can figure it out myself.

Aretha: Look at this. It’s a diagram of the controls and this section has illustrations on how to use the different modes. Do you want me to read it to you while you’re hooking it up?

Carl: No. Now give me that manual. I work alone.

### 0450 Getting a Bad Reputation

Lance: Did you see Kim at the party last Saturday?

Paulina: Yeah, I saw her. Why?

Lance: She was wearing a skimpy dress and all of the men were leering at her all night. I used to think she was a nice girl. Isn’t she worried that she’ll get a reputation?

Paulina: A reputation for what?

Lance: For being…you know.

Paulina: No, I don’t know.

Lance: For being easy! It doesn’t take much for people to jump to the wrong conclusions when a woman is dressed like that.

Paulina: So based on one dress she wore to a party, you’re ready to consider her promiscuous.

Lance: No, not just based on that. The guys at the party were talking and one of them said he used to date her, and he said…

Paulina: Now you’re listening to some sleazy guy at a party boasting about his conquest. The question is, why are you so ready to give credibility to rumors like that?

Lance: Whoa, don’t go ballistic on me. I was only telling you what I heard. I thought you might be interested.

Paulina: Well, you thought wrong. I used to think that women were catty, but you men are much, much worse!

### 0451 Buying Car Insurance

Agent: Hello, Krashit Insurance.

Jackie: Hi, I wanted to get a quote for car insurance.

Agent: Sure, I can help you with that. I assume you want liability insurance, but what other coverage would you like to get?

Jackie: Umm…I’m not sure. This is my first car.

Agent: In that case, let me make a few suggestions. You’ll definitely want collision insurance. It pays to fix your car if you hit another car or run into something.

Jackie: Okay, sure, I want that.

Agent: You’ll also want comprehensive insurance. It pays for damage to your car.

Jackie: How’s it different from collision insurance?

Agent: Well, it pays for damage to your car that’s not a result of an accident, like in the case of theft, weather damage, or vandalism.

Jackie: Okay, I want that, too.

Agent: You’ll want property damage insurance to pay for damage you cause to someone else’s property. On top of that, you’ll want uninsured motorist insurance in case the other driver doesn’t have insurance or doesn’t have enough insurance to pay for the damage to your car.

Jackie: Umm…I guess I’ll take that, too.

Agent: And I don’t think you can do without medical payments insurance. It pays for your medical bills and those of your passengers in case of an accident. Should I get you a quote for all of this coverage?

Jackie: Why don’t you hold off on that? I’m not sure how I’m going to pay for all that and buy gas, too!

### 0452 Dealing with Unhappy Employees

Asa: I don’t know how we got stuck with reviewing employee complaints. This has got to be the worst job ever!

Samantha: This is important work and somebody has to do it. Come on, let’s get started.

Asa: I think it’s bad for morale to allow employees to file complaints. We’re all overworked and underpaid, and most of us are burned out.

Samantha: How else are disgruntled employees going to voice their grievances?

Asa: Personally, I think it’s stupid for employees to put their complaints on paper. Aren’t they worried about retaliation from the management?

Samantha: I don’t think that’s going to happen. The whole point of having this system is to resolve any problems before they get blown out of proportion. It’s to everybody’s benefit to try to make this work.

Asa: On the contrary, I think it makes for a dysfunctional workplace: Employees thinking of things to complain about and the management with their backs up against the wall. I just don’t get it.

Samantha: No, I guess you don’t. If you don’t like how things are done around here, I’ve got a suggestion for you.

Asa: What?

Samantha: File a complaint.

### 0453 Making an Emergency Medical Call

Operator: Emergency operator. State your emergency.

Dirk: We need an ambulance right away.

Operator: What is your name?

Dirk: Dirk, Dirk Omora.

Operator: Can you tell me what happened?

Dirk: There was a car accident.

Operator: Where are you?

Dirk: I’m not sure. I was driving in my car when I saw the pileup. I’m somewhere on Blossom Road. Can you trace my location?

Operator: Yes, we’ll try to do that. Can you see if anyone is hurt?

Dirk: One of the drivers is lying on the ground unconscious, and the other one is bleeding. There’s someone trapped in the back of her car, too. We need to rescue her before the car explodes! I’m going to see if I can help.

Operator: Sir, I need you to stay on the line. I’m sending an ambulance right now, and they’ll have the Jaws of Life and other equipment to do the job. The paramedics will be there very soon.

Dirk: Okay, but hurry!

### 0454 Hailing and Taking a Taxi

My company sent me on my first business trip, and I was supposed to travel around the city in taxis. Having never ridden in a taxi before, I had problems from start to finish.

First, I had trouble hailing a cab. I didn’t realize that when the taxi’s light is off that the cabbie is off duty. No wonder they took no notice of me.

Then, a cab did pull over and I told him where I wanted to go. He said, though, that he wouldn’t take me because he wouldn’t be able to get a return fare!

I was looking around for a taxi stand when another cab pulled over, but my troubles didn’t stop there.

Cabbie: Where to?

Ignacio: I’d like to go the Hamilton Building downtown. There’s a flat rate, isn’t there?

Cabbie: No, we don’t have flat rates.

Ignacio: But a flat rate to downtown is required by law, isn’t it?

Cabbie: Do you want to go downtown or not? I’ve already started the meter.

Ignacio: Where are your posted rates?

Cabbie: We don’t have any. The first mile is $3.50 and each quarter mile is $2.00.

Ignacio: That doesn’t sound right to me. I think I’ll try another cab.

Cabbie: Suit yourself!

I remembered what my co-worker told me. She said to steer clear of private cabs, like this one. The cabbies don’t have licenses and some of them will really take you for a ride – and not the kind you want!

### 0455 Ending a Bad Date

I was on a date from hell.

I agreed to go out with this guy who lives in the same apartment building as I do, but he’s turned out to be a real creep. He was nice enough at the start of the date, but then he started drinking. Now he’s drunk and I’m miserable.

I wanted to let him down gently since I’d be seeing him around the apartment building, but I didn’t want to spend another minute with him.

Fatima: Listen, Rob, I just don’t think we’re hitting it off. You’re a really nice guy, but I just don’t think we have much chemistry.

Rob: Are you kidding? I’m having the time of my life. We’re just getting started here. Bartender, another round!

I realized that I needed to be more straightforward with him in case I was giving him mixed signals.

Fatima: I’m sorry, Rob, but I think this is the end of the road for this date. Thanks a lot for the drinks and I’ll see you around.

Rob: What? You’re leaving? How about a goodnight kiss? Come over here and give me that kiss.

I wanted to keep my cool, but when he tried to kiss me, that did it!

Fatima: You’re stinking drunk and this date is over. Capisce?

I got up and left. What is it about alcohol that turns Prince Charming into a frog?

### 0456 Sending Business Packages

Maria: I need this package to arrive in Tulsa by next Wednesday.

Sam: Sure, I’ll send it UPS or FedEx using their ground service. It’ll be cheaper than sending it using their overnight service and we can still track it. Is it going to a business?

Maria: Yes, it is.

Sam: Okay, I’ll mark that it’s going to a commercial address.

Maria: That’s fine. I’ll also need these contracts to get to Tokyo by Friday. Send it to the home of the president of the company.

Sam: I’ll send it DHL and use the residential delivery service. This seems like a large package for just contracts.

Maria: I’m also including a gift for the president’s wife.

Sam: If it’s breakable, I’ll pack it really well and then get it insured. What’s the declared value?

Maria: It’s about $700. Oh, and I want this box to go to Olten, Switzerland, but just send it regular mail through the post office. Make sure I get delivery confirmation, though.

Sam: No problem. I’ll just need to fill out a customs declaration form. What are the contents?

Maria: They’re books.

Sam: Okay, I’ll take care of it.

Maria: Thanks. What would I do without you?

Sam: The real question is, what would the mail services do without you?

### 0457 Apologizing for a Bad Date

I really blew it last night. I finally asked my neighbor, Fatima, out on a date and she walked out on me in the middle of it.

I didn’t blame her. I wanted to make a good impression on her, but I felt I was floundering a half an hour into the date. I decided to liven things up a bit with a few drinks. I got carried away and got stinking drunk. What an idiot! I had to call her to apologize.

Fatima: Hello.

Rob: Uh, hi, Fatima. This is Rob calling.

Fatima: Oh.

Rob: Please don’t hang up. I need to apologize for my atrocious behavior last night. I was a real jerk and I’m really, really sorry.

Fatima: I appreciate the apology. Thanks, but I have to go now.

Rob: Hold on one second, please! I want to explain. I thought I was boring you at the beginning of the date and that’s why I started in on the drinks. I’m not normally a lush, really! I was nervous and worried that things weren’t going well, and I thought a couple of drinks would loosen me up.

Fatima: Okay, I understand that, but that doesn’t excuse the groping.

Rob: Groping? What groping?

Fatima: You don’t remember? You insisted on a goodnight kiss.

Rob: I did? It’s all a blur. I don’t remember anything after you called me a creep.

Fatima: You tried to kiss me and I walked out. Can you blame me?

Rob: No, I can’t. I deserved much worse. After that, I can also understand why you’d never want to speak to me again. Is there any way I can make it up to you?

Fatima: I really don’t know…

Rob: I promise not to have a drop of alcohol.

Fatima: I’ll have to think about it.

Rob: And I’ll have both of my hands tied behind my back the entire time.

Fatima: Maybe. Let me sleep on it.

At least it wasn’t a “no.” There’s a glimmer of hope for a second chance!

### 0458 Going to the Playground

My wife was out of town on business and our nanny was sick, so I took the day off from work to take care of our two kids: Livia, who is two, and Augustus, who is three and a half. I thought that going to the playground would be a good thing to do, but it turned out to be an accident waiting to happen.

When we got to the playground, the kids jumped out of the car. Livia got onto the merry-go-round, pushing it as hard as she could. The trouble was, there were a couple of toddlers playing on it and they fell backwards, getting the wind knocked out of them.

Augustus, on the other hand, ran straight for the swing set and almost got decapitated! Then he went over to the see-saw and almost got smashed when he tried to run under it! He ran out of my grasp and onto the jungle gym. He started hanging off the monkey bars. I caught him just in time as he fell!

When I turned around, I saw that Livia had got onto the slide and slid head first into the sandbox! Good thing she wasn’t hurt.

By this time, I realized my mistake. Far from a safe place to play, for two lively kids and one father, the playground was a deathtrap!

### 0459 Watching Political Commentary Shows

Laura: I really don’t like these political commentary shows. They purportedly present both sides of an issue, but the commentator is always biased.

Joon: Oh, I don’t think so. Each show invites pundits on each side of the political spectrum. In this show, for instance, the pundits each take turns presenting their arguments.

Laura: You mean they each present the party line, right? I find it so predictable what each side will say, since they always invite people who have opinions that are poles apart.

Joon: That’s not always true. This other show has a roundtable format. Each person listens to the others and they debate the issues.

Laura: On that show, it’s not what they say, but how they say it. They treat the others’ opinions with such contempt. You can hear the loathing in their voices and they constantly talk over each other. I’m surprised you can bear to watch it.

Joon: I find it stimulating. I like a good fight.

Laura: I guess it’s better for them to do it on screen than on the streets!

### 0460 Working in a Bad Economy

Shivon: This bad economy is really taking its toll.

Lex: Tell me about it! My company has already laid off 20% of its workforce, and now the management is talking about cutting salaries. It goes without saying that there won’t be any bonuses this year.

Shivon: What are you complaining about? At least you still have a job. Try working as a freelancer. I’ve had to cut my hourly rate to compete with all of the people flooding the job market.

Lex: At least you’re still able to pick and choose your clients. I have to do what my bosses tell me, no matter what. If they say I have to work overtime, that’s what I have to do. I don’t even get compensated for it! You can bill by the hour.

Shivon: What’s the good of billing by the hour if I don’t have any clients? You don’t know how good you have it. I don’t want to hear another word until you walk a mile in my shoes!

Lex: Ditto!

### 0461 Using a Guidebook

Nicki: Wow, did you buy out the bookstore?!

Tony: Very funny. I just got a few guidebooks for our trip to Vancouver. I want to study up on what the must-see sights are, and then decide whether we can do some self-guided tours or need to book guided tours.

Nicki: That’s very conscientious of you. The trip isn’t for three months.

Tony: I know, but I want to start sketching out an itinerary now. I’m going to start out by reading the orientation chapters so I get a feel for the city.

Nicki: Good, then at least one of us will know where to go and what to do.

Tony: After that, I’m going to read the helpful hints in the accommodations section. I want to make sure we stay in the heart of the city with plenty of nightlife. I’ll read the section on day trips, too, in case we have some extra time.

Nicki: It sounds like you’ve got it covered.

Tony: I do. I also want to spend some time learning some survival phrases so I can talk to the locals.

Nicki: Survival phrases? To visit Vancouver?

Tony: Yeah, we won’t be able to get around without learning some French, you know.

Nicki: Really? Hmm. I think you’d better keep reading.

### 0462 Having Doubts About Getting Married

Charlotte: What are you doing in here? The entire wedding party is looking for you.

Chris: Yeah, I know.

Charlotte: Well, what’s the matter? You’re not getting cold feet, are you?

Chris: That’s just it. I’m really having doubts about getting married. What am I doing here? I think I’m about to make the biggest mistake of my life!

Charlotte: Whoa, slow down. You’re just a little freaked out right now. That’s understandable. Just don’t do anything rash.

Chris: I have an irresistible impulse to run. I’ve got to get out of here!

Charlotte: You’d better do some serious soul-searching before you decide to leave Kerry at the altar. It would be a life-altering experience for her and for you. She may never get over it.

Chris: You’re right, but what can I do? If I go through with this, I may regret it for the rest of my life.

Charlotte: Sit down and stay put. I’m going to get someone who’ll set you straight.

Chris: Who?

Charlotte: Kerry!

### 0463 Washing the Car

I was driving down the road when I saw a group of teenagers holding up signs for a fundraising car wash for their school. My car was very dirty, so I pulled over and paid for a car wash and a wax.

I think that the students had more enthusiasm than car washing skills. Yes, they had hoses, buckets filled with soapy water, and sponges, but they seemed more interested in getting each other wet than in getting the dirt off the car. I kept wanting to jump up and say, “Hey, you missed a spot!” but I didn’t.

After washing the car, they rinsed it and dried it with towels. They also vacuumed the interior and washed the windows. At least the windows were spotless. Finally, they waxed and polished the car, and were finished.

I went over to inspect the washed car. All I can say is I’m glad this was a fundraiser to support their school. If these students do as well in their classes as they did on my car, they need all the education they can get!

### 0464 Talking About Inventory

Foreman: Okay, people. Listen up.

This is your first day on the job in this warehouse and you need to know what we do here. This warehouse keeps all of the stock for the 10 stores in this region. We get merchandise from the supplier and it’s our job to organize it and store it until it goes to the retail outlets. One of the reasons our stores can offer such low prices is that they operate on the principles of economies of scale. This means that we buy in bulk and there’s a lot to catalogue and store. We even have some stock on consignment, so it’s all the more important that we’re able to keep track of any merchandise that comes through here. Any questions?

Carla: Yeah, are we the end of the supply chain or do we send merchandise to other warehouses?

Foreman: We are it. Merchandise comes to us from suppliers and we distribute it to the stores. Any other questions?

Carla: Does merchandise ever go missing?

Foreman: It better not go missing under my watch. That’s why we do an inventory twice a year. If anything is unaccounted for, I won’t be a happy camper. Okay, people, line up to get your assignments…

### 0465 Describing Boring and Exciting Things

Ina: It was a great idea to split up to go see different movies. I really liked The McQuillanator!

Paco: I’m glad to hear it. You made a better choice than I did. The biopic I saw was mind-numbing. I was bored to death!

Ina: Really? My movie was great. It was action-packed and fast-paced. I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.

Paco: I wish I had been. My movie moved at a snail’s pace and what was supposed to be dramatic was just repetitive. I can’t believe I sat through that entire thing. I’m sure I nodded off more than once.

Ina: That’s too bad. You should have abandoned your theater and joined me in mine. I’m still feeling the adrenaline rush.

Paco: Yeah, but instead I got a good nap. What a waste of money!

Ina: Just consider it a good lesson learned.

Paco: What lesson?

Ina: Let me pick the movies. I know a good bang for the buck!

### 0466 Having a Good or Bad Bedside Manner

Cho: I’m not sure I’m cut out to be a doctor.

Joy: I think you’ll be great. I’ve seen you with patients and you have a great bedside manner – not like Gregory.

Cho: Why? What’s wrong with his bedside manner?

Joy: I’ve seen him with patients and he can be really callous. For instance, I was in the room last week when he was telling one of his patients that she was taking a turn for the worse.

Cho: What did he say?

Joy: He just blurted it out. He told her the diagnosis, and he didn’t even try to soften the news when she asked about her prognosis. He did absolutely nothing to try to comfort or reassure her.

Cho: I feel sorry for the patient.

Joy: That’s the point. Gregory didn’t, and it didn’t seem to faze him that the patient was very upset and close to hysterics.

Cho: That’s terrible. I’ll try to remember to be more compassionate with my patients.

Joy: Don’t worry. It’s against your nature to be anything but considerate.

### 0467 Buying Men’s Shirts

Francesca: Hurry up! Come out of that fitting room so I can see how the dress shirt fits.

Eddie: The first one didn’t fit at all. The sleeves were too short and it was too form fitting. I like my shirts to be on the roomy side. I’m trying on the second one.

Francesca: Come on, let me see. Okay, I think this one fits you pretty well. The collar is the right size, not too loose or tight. The cuffs on this one fall at just the right place, don’t you think?

Eddie: Yeah, it’s fine.

Francesca: Try on the T-shirts.

Eddie: Okay, but I’m not trying on the fancy ones with a V-neck. I like my T-shirts the old-fashioned way – with a crew neck.

Francesca: All right, but try on the short-sleeve and the long-sleeve ones, too. Hurry up.

Eddie: Hold on, I’m changing as fast as I can. Oh, geez. I’ve heard of oversized T-shirts, but this is ridiculous.

Francesca: Let me see. You’re right. You’ve got enough room in there for two people!

### 0468 Organizing Your Office

I have a very disorganized office. My co-workers have been making jokes about my office for a long time, and my boss finally cracked down on me. He told me: “Get the office organized by Friday – no excuses!” What choice did I have?

I’ve always been a pack rat. I hate to throw anything out, but I was determined to turn over a new leaf. It’s true I’ve worked in the same office for four years and have accumulated a lot of paper, but if I put my mind to it, I’m sure I could get rid of all of the clutter.

There are piles of paper and files all over my desk and sorting them out won’t be easy. All I need to do, though, is to purge my filing cabinets of old files to make room for new ones. I also need to triage the papers on my desk, on the floor, and in my overflowing inbox. Then, I only need to make new files and label them. Finally, I’ll only keep those things on my desk that are essential and get rid of anything that isn’t.

That’s a pretty good plan, don’t you think? I’ve already made a to-do list. Now all I need to do is start on those tasks!

### 0469 Rearranging Living Room Furniture

Amy: I think rearranging the furniture will make the living room look more spacious. Don’t you?

Jacob: Uh, sure.

Amy: Can you help me move this couch against this wall?

Jacob: Okay, but are you sure you want it over there? Because it’s really heavy and a pain to move.

Amy: I’m sure. Let’s move the loveseat across from it. Now, can you move the recliner into the corner?

Jacob: Uh! Here?

Amy: Umm…a little to the left. Perfect!

Jacob: Are you sure?

Amy: Absolutely! Okay, the end tables go on each side of the couch, and the coffee table goes between the couch and the loveseat.

Jacob: Where do you want the ottoman and where do the lamps go?

Amy: Put the ottoman next to the loveseat. The table lamps go on the end tables and the floor lamp should go next to the recliner.

Jacob: There’s no room for the rocking chair.

Amy: Hmm…I guess the rocking chair can go into the guestroom.

Jacob: What about the credenza?

Amy: You’re right. This new configuration won’t work.

Jacob: You mean you want to put everything back to where it was?

Amy: Yup, we’re back to square one!

### 0470 Avoiding Show and Movie Spoilers

Lee: I’m reading this article about the new season of our favorite show. It’s premiering next week.

Kira: Don’t tell me anything about it, especially spoilers.

Lee: But don’t you want to know which guest stars will be making appearances and the plot twists that are coming up?

Kira: No, I don’t! I don’t watch movie trailers and I don’t read reviews. It spoils the fun when you already know what’s going to happen. Where’s the suspense?

Lee: The blogs and reviews I read all have “spoiler alerts” and I avoid reading those sections. Let me just tell you one thing I read…

Kira: Stop right there! I’m covering my ears. I want to stay in the dark, completely in the dark. Got it?

Lee: Okay, I won’t let the cat out of the bag, but we’re in for a wild ride this season.

Kira: I’m not listening! I’m not listening!

### 0471 Trying to Get Off the Phone

Erin: So I told Joey that I had no intention of letting him use my car again. Can you believe the nerve of that guy, after what he did?

Curran: That’s terrible, but I’m going to have to let you go. I have an appointment…

Erin: But I didn’t tell you what else he said. He said that running over my cat was just an accident. That’s bull. He said I should be thankful that he took Fifi to a veterinarian!

Curran: Yeah, I can see why you’re mad. I think I have a call on the other line…

Erin: Well, I’m glad you agree with me. I said to him that Fifi may be as good as new now, but that is no thanks to him! He’s never liked Fifi and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was gunning for her when he ran her over. He should count himself lucky he’s getting off scot-free for trying to kill my cat. I said…

Curran: Sorry to have to cut this short, but I really have to get going.

Erin: Oh, sure, but just let me tell you what I plan to do if he asks me again.

Curran: I really want to hear all about it, but…but…nature calls!

Erin: Oh, okay, call me back. I haven’t even told you what Sam told me about Ben yesterday. It’s a real shocker!

Curran: Uh…right. I can’t wait to hear all about it.

### 0472 Feeling Nervous About Public Speaking

Simone: They’re about to introduce you. You’re on next. Are you ready?

Gabriel: No…yes…no!

Simone: You don’t look so well. Are you all right?

Gabriel: I don’t know. My palms are clammy, I’m breaking out into a cold sweat, and my legs feel like jelly.

Simone: It sounds like a bad case of stage fright, that’s all. Just take a deep breath. You’ll be fine.

Gabriel: I have butterflies in my stomach and my mouth is dry. Where can I get a glass of water?

Simone: I don’t know and there isn’t time.

Gabriel: Oh God, if I go out there, I’m going to freeze up or get tongue-tied. I just know it.

Simone: Get a hold of yourself. You’re well prepared and you’ll do a great job. Okay, they’ve just announced your name. Get out there!

Gabriel: I can’t!

Simone: The entire audience is waiting for you. Pull yourself together and get out there!

Gabriel: Here goes nothing!

### 0473 Showing Respect and Disrespect

Kadir: Stop that! Stop snickering! Gabriel Voltaire is an author of great acclaim. You should show a little reverence.

Melissa: Yes, but he seems to have a bad case of stage fright. I know it’s an honor to hear him speak, but it’s hard to show reverence when the man is sweating like a pig!

Kadir: He’s not sweating like a pig. He’s just talking passionately about his writing. I, for one, appreciate his level of dedication to his work.

Melissa: I admire his work, too, but he’s making a fool of himself. Really, who can pay attention to what he’s saying when he’s stuttering like that.

Kadir: Unlike you, I can listen to the genius of his words without worrying about a little stuttering.

Melissa: The man is making a spectacle of himself. I think he needs to stick to writing and give up public speaking.

Kadir: Shh! That’s enough. I won’t hear another word said against him.

Melissa: Whatever you say. I’ll leave you to your hero worship. For me, enough is enough!

### 0474 Having Trouble Sleeping

Luis: So, how are the newlyweds doing?

Stevie: Oh, we’re great. I’m just a little tired.

Luis: Well, that goes with the territory, right?

Stevie: No, that’s not what I mean. Patrick has been keeping me up with his snoring.

Luis: Oh, that’s a bummer.

Stevie: Yeah, it really is. I’m usually awakened soon after I fall asleep, and then I toss and turn all night. That’s not all. Patrick also talks in his sleep.

Luis: Wow, that’s terrible. I’d make a beeline for some sleeping pills, if I were you.

Stevie: I took some one night last week, but I woke up groggy and disoriented. I’d rather have insomnia than load up on drugs.

Luis: Have you tried waking him up when he snores or talks in his sleep?

Stevie: I tried that one night, but he just ended up sleepwalking!

Luis: Geez, what are you going to do?

Stevie: I wish I knew.

Luis: It’s a little early in your marriage for separate bedrooms, but I wouldn’t rule it out.

Stevie: I’ll keep it in mind. If I don’t get a good night’s sleep soon, separate bedrooms will be the least of our problems!

### 0475 Hiring a Hitman

Gus: Are you Shirley?

Shirley: Yeah, thanks for agreeing to meet me here. I’m told you’re the best sniper in the business and you can be discreet. I need a hitman who can do a job, then make himself scarce.

Gus: I’m your man. Tell me about it.

Shirley: There’s someone who’s been a thorn in my side, keeping me up at night, and it’s time to take him out.

Gus: Taking care of problems is my specialty. I’ll need a down payment now and the balance when I finish him off. We shouldn’t meet again, so I’ll tell you later where to make a drop.

Shirley: All right.

Gus: Good. How will I be able to spot the target?

Shirley: Here’s a picture. He’s usually in the yard in the afternoons.

Gus: You want me to kill a dog?!

Shirley: Right, he’s my neighbor’s dog and he keeps me up every night. Is that a problem?

Gus: You bet it is. Who do you think I am? People are disposable, but dogs? They’re a man’s best friend.

Shirley: Are you kidding me? You won’t take the job?

Gus: Nope, I won’t. If you want to pay good money to take out a dog, then that’s your prerogative, but I have my standards!

### 0476 Taking Chances in Business

I’ve always been a pretty cautious investor. I like my investments to be conservative and I usually invest only in sure things. Recently, though, I’ve been tempted to take more risk.

My friend, Bernie, is a very successful fund manager and he is willing to let me get in on one of his schemes. According to Bernie, he has a way to take advantage of the current economic climate so that he and his investors aren’t susceptible to the same market forces affecting other investors. Barring any significant changes to the current economy, I should be raking it in before the end of the year.

Bernie isn’t someone who shoots from the hip, so if he says that this investment is going to be profitable, who am I to ask questions? I’m very tempted to throw caution to the wind and to take a chance. After all, it’s only money, right?

### 0477 Planning a Gourmet Meal

Hung: I can’t believe that the famous food critic, Julia Schilds, will be eating in my restaurant tomorrow night. I need to prepare a gourmet menu that’s going to be mind-blowing.

Padma: She wouldn’t be coming here if she didn’t already know that your cuisine is considered some of the best food in the city.

Hung: That may be so, but you’re only as good as your last meal. I need to think of some delicacies that will really impress her. Let’s see, I think we should offer two new hors d’oeuvres, in addition to the ones already on the menu.

Padma: Are you sure the chefs in the kitchen will be able to handle making six different hors d’oeuvres?

Hung: Hmm, maybe not.

Padma: Why don’t you concentrate on the entrées? I’m sure you could come up with one or two new dishes that will really impress her.

Hung: Okay, but I don’t want to put all of my eggs in one basket. I need to have dishes in every course that are out of this world.

Padma: Come on. You’re a great chef. What’s the worst she could say?

Hung: Lots of things. She could say that this is a run-of-the-mill restaurant with mediocre food that she wouldn’t even feed to her cat!

Padma: Okay, yes, she could say those things but she won’t. Your food will be mouthwatering and delectable, and her taste buds will thank you for it!

### 0478 Having Plumbing Problems

Mickey: Hello, McQuillan Plumbing.

Colleen: Hi, I’m having a lot of plumbing problems. Can you send a plumber out to my house right away?

Mickey: Yes, we can. But first, let’s find out what the problems are.

Colleen: Well, to start, my toilet won’t flush and it’s overflowing.

Mickey: An overflowing toilet – check. What else?

Colleen: The sink in the bathroom is stopped up and the pipes underneath the sink are leaking.

Mickey: A stopped up sink and leaking pipes – check. What else?

Colleen: The garbage disposal in the kitchen is making funny noises and the water won’t drain.

Mickey: A busted garbage disposal – check. Is that all?

Colleen: No, the faucet in the shower is stuck and I can’t shut off the water.

Mickey: A stuck faucet – got it. What else?

Colleen: That’s it.

Mickey: You’ve got some really big problems there.

Colleen: Yes, I know. That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you. Can you send someone out right away?

Mickey: Sure, no problem. How about next Tuesday?

Colleen: Next Tuesday?! Didn’t you hear me? These are emergencies!

Mickey: Yes, but all of our plumbers are booked up until next Tuesday. Should I put you down for a morning appointment?

Colleen: Forget it! By next Tuesday, I’ll be under 10 feet of water!

### 0479 Using Frequent Flyer Miles

Anne: Where were you this past weekend? I tried calling you on Friday to see if you wanted to go to the movies with me.

Jurgen: I was in Chicago for a long weekend.

Anne: Chicago? I didn’t know you were planning a trip. I thought you were pretty strapped this month. A ticket to Chicago would set you back at least $300.

Jurgen: I am pretty strapped, but I wanted to go to my friend Rachel’s wedding. I was able to use my frequent flyer miles to get a ticket. I was lucky that those weren’t blackout dates.

Anne: Oh, that explains it. You’ve been traveling a lot using your frequent flyer miles. How do you rack up so many miles? I’m enrolled in the frequent flyer programs of three different airlines, but I never seem to have enough miles to redeem them for a ticket or even an upgrade.

Jurgen: The trick is to get a credit card that gives you miles. For every dollar I charge on my credit card, I get one mile. Since I use my credit card for a lot of business purchases, the miles add up pretty quickly. I also use a lot of the hotels and restaurants that partner with the airlines, and doing that gives me bonus miles.

Anne: Aren’t there a lot of restrictions? Do you ever have problems redeeming the miles?

Jurgen: Yeah, there are some restrictions, but I work around them. There are fewer restrictions if you have elite status, but I’m a long way from that.

Anne: So I need to get a credit card that gives me frequent flyer miles.

Jurgen: Yeah, but a word to the wise: spend carefully. You don’t want to rack up credit card debt for the sake of racking up frequent flyer miles!

Anne: Point taken. Thanks for the tip.

### 0480 Riding in a Carpool

Roberto: Hey, Loreto. Got a minute?

Loreto: I’m going to a meeting off-site, but we can talk if you don’t mind walking me to my car.

Roberto: Sure, okay. I just wanted to ask if you’re interested in carpooling to work. We only live a few blocks from each other.

Loreto: Thanks for asking, but I’m not sure carpooling would work for me. Sometimes I run late in the morning and I wouldn’t want to hold you up.

Roberto: We wouldn’t have to commute together every day, only on those days that are convenient for both of us. Carpooling has its advantages, too. In addition to doing our part for the environment, we could use the high-occupancy carpool lanes. That’ll save time, especially if there’s a lot of traffic congestion.

Loreto: Yeah, I guess that could cut down on our commute time.

Roberto: We also get preferential treatment for parking on the days we carpool.

Loreto: How would it work? Do we set up a schedule and take turns driving?

Roberto: Why don’t I swing by and pick you up tomorrow morning and we can talk more about it?

Loreto: If you don’t mind picking me up en route, that would be great. By the way, how do you know where I live?

Roberto: Oh, I asked around. See you tomorrow.

### 0481 Listening to Music

Victoria: I see that you have a really extensive music collection.

J.D.: Yeah, I like a lot of different genres of music.

Victoria: Do you have the new J.McQ album? He’s my favorite artist. I just got it and I like all of the tracks on it.

J.D.: No, I haven’t heard it yet. Do you have it on your MP3 player?

Victoria: Yeah, here, I’ve cued up the first track.

J.D.: Hmm…I like the beat of the first song, but I’m not blown away by the rest of it. It’s also a really bad mix. The bass is up too high; you can hardly hear the treble. Is the whole album like that?

Victoria: Yeah, I guess so. I didn’t notice. Maybe the volume wasn’t up high enough.

J.D.: No, it was up high enough. Maybe he’s just not that good a vocalist and the sound engineers are trying to cover it up in the mixing.

Victoria: Are you kidding? He’s an amazing singer. Come on, listen to another track. I’m sure you’ll change your mind.

J.D.: No, thanks. I’d rather listen to a bunch of fighting cats than listen to anymore of J.McQ!

### 0482 Talking About Architecture

Iktinos: I can’t believe we’re in one of the world’s most famous structures. Look at this architecture!

Pinda: Yeah, great, another old building. I’m going to sit in that bay window and rest my feet while you walk around.

Iktinos: Come on, come with me. Just look at these columns and beams. They’re over 2,000 years old!

Pinda: Right, they’re old. Everything we’ve seen these past two weeks has been old. What’s so special about this?

Iktinos: Are you trying to tell me that you don’t think this dome is impressive? It’s one of the largest in the world. Look at those cornices and skylights. I’ve never seen anything like them.

Pinda: This building has a good facade, with nice balance and symmetry, but I’m so tired of looking at the same style of building, one after another. Aren’t we going to see anything else today?

Iktinos: We are seeing some of the most important monuments to human ingenuity.

Pinda: You’re right, but I’m too tired to walk up and down all three stories. You go. I’ll stay here on this balcony.

Iktinos: What are you going to do here?

Pinda: I’m going to think about how I’d remodel the building to bring it up to date.

Iktinos: You’re hopeless!

### 0483 Using Hair Products and Accessories

Danny: You’re going to the prom. How exciting! How should we style you hair?

Clarissa: I’m really not sure. I was hoping you would have some ideas.

Danny: I do, but first we need to see if we have the right tools. Let’s look in your bathroom. Here’s some shampoo and conditioner, but where are the gel, mousse, and hairspray?

Clarissa: Here, they’re on this shelf. Here’s a hairdryer and some rollers, too. Do you think we’ll need the curling iron or the flat iron?

Danny: I’m not sure, but put them here, just in case. Okay, now I need a brush and comb, and some bobby pins. We’ll need some elastic bands, too, to pull your hair back.

Clarissa: Here, they’re all in this drawer.

Danny: Oh, this is a pretty barrette, but we won’t need it for tonight. Okay, ready for the transformation?

Clarissa: I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.

Danny: Okay, let the fun begin!

### 0484 Getting a Performance Evaluation

Emil: Have a seat. As you know, we need to talk about your annual performance evaluation. Is there anything you’d like to say before we get started?

Sandra: Yes, there is. I’ve tried really hard this year to improve on some of the shortcomings identified in my evaluation last year.

Emil: Hmm, I’m afraid that’s not reflected in this year’s evaluation. Your supervisor noted on the report that you’ve been performing below par for several months now, and your productivity is down, too.

Sandra: I can’t imagine why she would say that. If I haven’t excelled on the new project, I’ve at least pulled my weight. I don’t think she can fault me on that.

Emil: On the contrary, she thinks that you’ve been slacking off and not giving 100 percent.

Sandra: I have had some personal issues, but I didn’t think they had been affecting my work. I guess I’ve let them bring down my performance.

Emil: This was a hard decision, but we’re putting you on probation for the next three months. You’ll have another evaluation at the end of that time. If your performance isn’t up to par by that time, we’ll have to think about letting you go.

Sandra: That won’t happen. I’m going to pull out all the stops to prove myself.

Emil: Good. That’s what I wanted to hear.

### 0485 Being Clumsy

Edward: Would you dance with me?

Bella: Me? I’d like to, but I don’t dance.

Edward: Why?

Bella: I have two left feet. I’m so clumsy, first I’d step all over your feet, and then I’d stumble all over the dance floor.

Edward: I don’t believe that. I bet you’re very graceful on the dance floor. You wouldn’t stumble; you’d glide across that floor.

Bella: I’m the most uncoordinated person alive. When I was little, I was even more awkward. My mother hated taking me shopping because I was so accident-prone. Everywhere we’d go, I was like a bull in a china shop. I’m not like Rosalie. Look at her. She’s so elegant.

Edward: Rosalie has nothing on you. Dance with me and I promise to catch you if you trip.

Bella: What if I step all over your feet?

Edward: You won’t get the chance. My feet will be moving so quickly, I will dazzle you with my agility and finesse.

Bella: Okay, you asked for it!

### 0486 Having Limited Mobility

Gail: Oh!

Mike: Are you okay?

Gail: Yeah, I’m just not used to these crutches yet. The doctor said I should start using them if I ever want to get out of this wheelchair, but I don’t have the strength to stand up.

Mike: You’ll get the hang of it. Don’t lose heart.

Gail: It should be easy now that my arm is out of the cast, but it just seems impossible. I feel I’m going to lose my balance each time I try to stand up.

Mike: Try again, and this time lean on me and I’ll try to serve as your legs until you can find your balance.

Gail: I wish I didn’t feel so utterly useless. It’s so frustrating!

Mike: I know. Just keep your eye on the ball and give it another try. The next thing you know, you’ll be limping along and then running a marathon. It’s just a matter of time before you get your mobility back.

Gail: Yeah, right. Okay, first things first. Let’s see if these useless legs of mine will cooperate this time.

### 0487 Watching Videos on the Internet

Sheila: Where are you going?

Rudy: I’m going to the video store to rent a movie for tonight. Do you want to come?

Sheila: You don’t need to do that. We can watch nearly any movie you want online.

Rudy: Oh, you mean we can pay to download it?

Sheila: Yeah, we can download it, but we don’t have to pay for it.

Rudy: What do you mean? You’re not using a file-sharing site, are you?

Sheila: Of course, I am. Everybody is doing it.

Rudy: Aside from the ethical issues, it’s so frustrating watching videos online. The ones that stream are constantly pausing to buffer. The interruptions drive me crazy!

Sheila: Yeah, sometimes, but there’s usually a workaround.

Rudy: Even so, the movies are usually pirated and they’re so grainy. I want to watch something in high definition. Come on, let’s go to the video store. It’ll be my treat.

Sheila: All right, if you insist, but why can’t we just pay to download it right here at home?

Rudy: We could do that, but where would we get the popcorn?

### 0488 Getting Around Regulations

Michael: I have some qualms about how we’re handling these accounts.

Leona: What do you mean?

Michael: There are strict regulations governing what we can and cannot do, and I think we’re violating those regulations.

Leona: Listen, it’s a matter of interpretation. We’re not flouting any regulations. We’re just not following the letter of the law.

Michael: I, for one, think that we’ve crossed the line. I’m not against some creative accounting, but what we’re doing is bordering on criminal.

Leona: Aren’t you blowing things out of proportion? The government makes laws knowing that people are going to try to get around them. There are always loopholes and that’s why they turn a blind eye to most of these types of activities. As long as we comply with most of the regulations, we’re not going to get into any hot water.

Michael: I appreciate your confidence, but I don’t share it. I think we’re in for some major problems if we don’t change the way we do business.

Leona: Come on, let’s go get some coffee and see what we can do about that overactive conscience of yours.

### 0489 Talking About Wealth

Anton: Look at that guy. He’s been in town two weeks and he’s already throwing his money around.

Vanessa: You know as well as I do that money talks. He’s just trying to make a splash in the business community.

Anton: If that were all he was doing then I wouldn’t say anything, but he’s a social climber of the worst kind. Who does he think he is?

Vanessa: He’s someone who’s used to getting his way, that’s obvious. He’s not the first affluent person to try to buy influence and social standing in a community.

Anton: Yeah, but look at all of the people in this town throwing themselves at him!

Vanessa: He has donated generously to the town and given to the arts. He’s even given money toward building the new community center, and it wasn’t chump change either. If he wants to be a patron in this town, who are we to look a gift horse in the mouth?

Anton: Right, so spreading money around gives him the right to walk around like he owns this town?

Vanessa: Is this a case of sour grapes?

Anton: Ha, right! Haven’t you heard? Money is the root of all evil!

### 0490 Eating Spoiled Food

Ryan: It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked meal.

Corrie: I’m happy to do it. First, though, let’s see what you have in your fridge.

Ryan: I have tons of food in there.

Corrie: What is that? It looks moldy.

Ryan: Oh, that’s cheese. I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts.

Corrie: Okay, but look at the “best if used by” date. This expired three months ago. What about this?

Ryan: That’s hamburger. Maybe you could make some spaghetti with meatballs.

Corrie: Not with this rotten meat. It’s definitely gone bad. Can’t you tell by the discoloration? Meat isn’t supposed to be gray.

Ryan: I guess you’re right. I bet this milk isn’t any good either, is it?

Corrie: Nope. It’s gone sour, and you might as well throw out this bread, too. It’s stale.

Ryan: Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?

Corrie: Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks tainted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted. You do have a lot of food in your kitchen, but it’s been here a long, long time.

Ryan: I don’t like things to go to waste.

Corrie: I guess not. I’m still willing to make you dinner, but we’ll have to do some shopping. My cooking isn’t the best, but I don’t usually give people food poisoning, and I don’t want to start now.

Ryan: Okay, okay, give me a list and I’ll go to the market.

Corrie: And while you’re there, I’ll see what I can do about getting rid of all of this hazardous waste!

### 0491 Having a Temper Tantrum

Alberto: What was that ear-splitting scream?!

Melissa: That little girl over there is having a temper tantrum.

Alberto: Oh, great! The movie hasn’t even started and that kid is already acting up.

Melissa: I hope she’s okay. She looks miserable. Maybe her parents can distract her somehow.

Alberto: She’s fine. She’s just looking for attention or frustrated she didn’t get what she wanted. If parents didn’t give in every time their child wanted something, kids wouldn’t throw tantrums.

Melissa: I don’t know. When my son was little, he used to throw tantrums when he didn’t know how to tell us what he needed. He got frustrated and sometimes, he would start kicking and screaming.

Alberto: Well, I don’t think that’s the case here. Look at those parents. They’re going to buy the girl some candy to quiet her down. That’s just rewarding her for her misbehavior.

Melissa: What would you do instead?

Alberto: I would set limits so that things like this never happened. In this case, I would give that girl a spanking. It’s all about having consequences for bad behavior.

Melissa: Oh, yeah? Did that work with your children?

Alberto: Uh, I don’t have any kids.

Melissa: That’s what I thought!

### 0492 Importing and Exporting Goods

Giselle: Good morning, Brian. This is Giselle calling from Intergroup in Kansas City.

Brian: Hi, Giselle. How are you?

Giselle: I’m great, thanks. Listen, the reason I’m calling is that I wanted to touch base with you about the new proposed regulations. Have you had a chance to review them?

Brian: We’ve only had time to give them a cursory look, but I think we have a grasp on what the changes will be. I don’t think that most of the new regulations would apply to our class of cargo. As long as our certificates of origin are in order and our shipping agents are well informed of the changes, we won’t have anything to be concerned about. Rest assured we’ll take care of all that.

Giselle: That’s good to hear. Won’t the customs procedures be different, though? I understand that there are changes to the regulations affecting which containers we can use and how we transport our freight.

Brian: No, lucky for us, all we need to do is to put some additional information on our waybills and make sure our packing lists reflect the same information.

Giselle: I’m relieved to hear that. You’ve really put my mind at ease, thanks.

Brian: Don’t mention it. While I have you on the phone, do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions about the latest order?

Giselle: No, not at all. Fire away.

### 0493 Ordering at a Sandwich Shop

Employee: Welcome to Grubway. What can I get for you?

Jared: I’m still deciding. I’m trying to lose weight and I hear that eating a sandwich for lunch every day will help me do that. Do you guys have a BLT or a club?

Employee: We don’t have a BLT, but we do have a ham or turkey club.

Jared: Okay, I’ll take the club.

Employee: Ham or turkey?

Jared: Can I get half and half, or better yet, can I get double ham and double turkey?

Employee: Sure, no problem.

Jared: I’d like cheese on that, too.

Employee: Would you like your bread toasted and the cheese melted?

Jared: Uh, sure.

Employee: What else would you like on your sandwich, the works?

Jared: What comes with the works?

Employee: It includes lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, olives, and pickles, and any spreads, condiments, or seasonings you’d like.

Jared: Oh, okay. I’ll have the works, but hold the pickles and olives. I’d like mayonnaise on the side, too, please. You know what? I’d like to add some chicken to that.

Employee: That’ll be $1.20 additional.

Jared: That’s fine. I’d also like extra cheese, and why don’t you add some roast beef, too?

Employee: Okay, I can do that. Will that be all?

Jared: Yeah, but while you’re at it, throw in two bags of chips and a couple of cookies.

Employee: Okay, I can ring you up down here.

Jared: Hey, tell me, how long before I start losing weight?

Employee: Well, that’s hard to say. You may want to look at the nutritional information chart to determine that.

Jared: Nah, I can already feel the pounds coming off!

### 0494 Types of Story Endings

Hamid: I just finished a really good book. I thought the characters were headed toward a tragic ending, but there was a twist near the end, and everything turned out well. It was so satisfying!

Rachel: It sounds sappy to me.

Hamid: It wasn’t sappy at all. It was just a happy ending. I know what you like. You like those disaster movies with catastrophic endings where everyone dies.

Rachel: At least that would be more realistic than everyone living happily ever after. I just saw the series finale of my favorite TV show. You know what they did? They ended the series with a cliffhanger. Nothing was resolved.

Hamid: That’s horrible! How could they leave people hanging like that? Weren’t you just a little mad?

Rachel: No, I wasn’t. The ending stayed true to the spirit of the show. It was a dark show and the ending was equally dark.

Hamid: Well, I bet they ended the series that way so they could make a movie sequel.

Rachel: Yeah, maybe, but I don’t care either way. Life doesn’t end neatly and neither should a good story.

Hamid: Remind me never to read any stories you write or any movies you make!

### 0495 Describing Winds and Storms

Ali: It’s just our luck that as soon as we arrive here for our island vacation, there’s a hurricane warning!

Mariela: It’s uncanny, isn’t it? On last year’s vacation, we crossed paths with a tornado and now this.

Ali: Yeah, that tornado was something. I had experienced windstorms before with really strong gusts of wind, but it was nothing like that tornado. Do you remember the way all of the windows, doors, and even walls rattled? The tornado blew down power lines and uprooted trees!

Mariela: That was terrifying. Do you think we’ll have another experience like that this time?

Ali: I really hope not. We came for ocean breezes, but if the hurricane makes landfall, we’ll have gale winds of up to 50 miles per hour!

Mariela: And we’re trapped here! What should we do?

Ali: We’ll just buckle down and wait it out. With any luck, the hurricane will miss the island altogether.

Mariela: With our luck, what’s the likelihood of that happening?!

### 0496 Driving a Company Car

Michael: Shall we?

Robin: Oh, this is nice. Did you get a new car?

Michael: No, this is a company car. Getting to drive one is one of the perks of my new job.

Robin: Does your new position call for a lot of driving?

Michael: It does. As the regional supervisor, I have to cover a large territory. I’ll be visiting all of the affiliates across the state.

Robin: Does that mean you can drive the company car anytime, anywhere?

Michael: Well, I’m only supposed to use it for official business since the company deducts the standard mileage allowance on their taxes, but there are ways to account for any extra miles I log.

Robin: You mean you fudge the mileage numbers?

Michael: You could say that. It’s no big deal. Everybody does it, or so I’ve heard. You know, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Do you want to go with me to San Diego this weekend?

Robin: That depends. Are you taking your company car?

Michael: I was thinking about it.

Robin: In that case, no, thanks. I don’t want to be an accessory to whatever rules you’re breaking.

Michael: Suit yourself, but what’s a company perk if you can’t take full advantage of it?

### 0497 Shopping for Bedding

Xavier: Thanks for helping me decorate my new apartment. Hey, where are you going?

Crystal: I’m going to the bedding department. Now that you have a new bed, you’ll need new bedding.

Xavier: Right, okay, but can’t I just get some sheets, a couple of pillows, and a blanket?

Crystal: That’s only the beginning. Oh, feel these sheets. No wonder they’re so soft. They have a very high thread count.

Xavier: Thread count?

Crystal: You’ll need a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and pillowcases. Did you get a queen- or a king-size bed?

Xavier: It’s a full-size bed.

Crystal: Okay, you’ll need a comforter and a duvet cover, too, and this bed skirt will make your bed look really nice.

Xavier: Bed skirt?

Crystal: Of course! You can’t leave your mattress exposed. That would look so tacky.

Xavier: If you say so…

Crystal: Wow, look at these canopies. Don’t you think…?

Xavier: You want to put a canopy over my bed?! No, that’s where I draw the line.

### 0498 Joking and Making Fun of People

Dmitry: Stan is really miffed at you. All of that teasing at lunch really upset him.

Charlene: What? I was just poking fun at him for trying to hit on the new, young receptionist.

Dmitry: You called him an old goat.

Charlene: I said that tongue in cheek. If he didn’t find that funny, then he can’t take a joke.

Dmitry: What about last week when you told that joke about fat people trying to dance and you made him the butt of the joke?

Charlene: Everybody knows I’m the class clown around here, and I make wisecracks about everybody. Nobody else is as thin-skinned as Stan.

Dmitry: I wouldn’t be so sure about that. I suggest you watch your back. The next joke may be on you.

Charlene: Why? What have you heard?

Dmitry: Oh, nothing. I just think it may be time for some payback – big time!

### 0499 Marrying a Gold Digger

Liza: Isn’t Jesse wonderful? I’m so glad you got to meet him last night.

Sinobu: Uh, he’s a little young for you, don’t you think? I know you’ve had boy toys in the past, but he takes the cake.

Liza: He’s no boy toy! It’s true that there’s a 30-year age difference, but who cares about age when you’re talking about love?

Sinobu: Well, he’s certainly dressed for the part, with all of that bling. That watch must have set him back a couple of grand, at least.

Liza: Oh, that was a little token of my affection for our one-month anniversary. I just wanted him to know how much I cared about him.

Sinobu: Well, he certainly knows now who holds the purse strings, if he didn’t before. I only hope he’s not preying on you.

Liza: How can you say that? I’ve never met anyone more honest or sincere.

Sinobu: He has you wrapped around his little finger, that’s for sure. I hope, for your sake, he’s not a gold digger, or that you see his true colors before you make it to the altar – again.

Liza: Oh, I knew it was a mistake talking to you about Jesse. You’re such a cynic!

Sinobu: And you’re a hopeless romantic!

### 0500 Taking Minutes of a Meeting

I was absent at last month’s meeting, so imagine my surprise when I found out that I had been elected the committee’s secretary! As part of my duties, I have to take minutes at each meeting. Taking minutes means I have to pay attention and try my best to transcribe what each person says, or at least do my best to summarize.

At yesterday’s meeting, the chair called the meeting to order and I conducted a roll call. Then, the chair went over the agenda and we discussed old business. We needed to vote on a couple of proposals from the past meeting, and it was my job to ask for a show of hands of those in favor of and those opposed to each one.

After that was done, we went on to new business. We talked about the first item of business for 20 minutes when someone suggested that we table the topic until the following meeting, and the participants agreed. After another long discussion about the second agenda item, we ran out of time. The chair adjourned the meeting.

Phew! That first meeting taught me a very good lesson. Never miss a meeting when new officers are being chosen!

### 0501 Buying Glasses

Alice: Ooh, look at these! Don’t I look great? I’ve always wanted sunglasses like these.

Pierre: You’re supposed to be here helping me pick out frames for my new bifocals.

Alice: I don’t know why you won’t get progressives. That’s what everybody is getting these days.

Pierre: I’ve always had bifocals and that’s what I’m going to get.

Alice: Are you going to get metal, plastic, or rimless frames?

Pierre: I’m not sure. The optician said that with my prescription, I could get any kind.

Alice: Okay, try these. How do they feel?

Pierre: I like the way the hinges move, but they’re too small for my head. Hey, these are nice. I think I’ll go with these.

Alice: There’s no accounting for taste! Okay, but what about the lenses? There are so many options. You can get ones that reduce glare, ones that darken automatically, ones with anti-scratch coating…

Pierre: I want to keep it nice and simple. I don’t want any of those options.

Alice: How about these for a backup pair? They’re designer frames.

Pierre: Give me those. I should have known better than to let you tag along. What was I thinking?!

### 0502 Storing Luggage on an Airplane

Yoshi: Can you hold my jacket while I try to get my roller bag down the aisle?

Tatiana: All right, but I have to roll my own bag down the aisle, you know.

Yoshi: Fine, give it back to me. All of these overhead bins are full. Where are we supposed to store them?

Tatiana: Look, there are two spaces in the back of the plane. You put our big bags in those bins, and I’ll put our carry-ons under the seats in front of us.

Yoshi: Fine, but these seats are already cramped, and now, I’ll have no legroom for the entire flight. Great! That’s what we get for not getting seats in the emergency exit row.

Tatiana: If we had seats in the emergency exit row, you’d be complaining about not being able to recline in your seat right now. At least we don’t have bulkhead seats. Stop grumbling and get moving before somebody else snags those overhead bins and we have to check those bags.

Yoshi: Whose idea was it to go on vacation?

Tatiana: It was mine. We both need some time to get away and unwind.

Yoshi: Yeah, right, I can’t remember the last time I felt this relaxed!

### 0503 Seeing a Dentist

Dr. Chung: Hello, Luis, I’m Dr. Chung. You’re here for a check-up and a cleaning, is that right?

Luis: Yes, that’s right.

Dr. Chung: Okay, let’s take a look. Have you had your wisdom teeth taken out?

Luis: No, I haven’t.

Dr. Chung: Hmm…You may need to do that soon. You’ve had a root canal?

Luis: Yes, about three years ago.

Dr. Chung: Does that hurt?

Luis: Ow!

Dr. Chung: I guess I hit a nerve. The bad news is that you may need another root canal soon. Let’s see if you have any cavities. Oh, I think there’s one here in your left molar. You’ll need to come back for a filling. Are you experiencing any sensitivity?

Luis: Yes, I am!

Dr. Chung: I’m not surprised. Your gums have receded and some of the root is showing. Do you use dental floss?

Luis: Um, yes.

Dr. Chung: I’ll have the dental hygienist show you how to brush and floss better so you can prevent the buildup of plaque and tartar. Any questions for me before the hygienist starts on your cleaning?

Luis: No, I’m just glad you didn’t say I need dentures!

Dr. Chung: No, you don’t. Not yet.

### 0504 Training Inexperienced Employees

Kazuko: I really appreciate you helping with the training of the newbies. I couldn’t have done it without you.

Martin: Don’t mention it. I remember when I was still wet behind the ears and the veterans in the company gave me the benefit of their time and expertise. They propped me up until I could stand on my own two feet.

Kazuko: I can’t imagine you as a novice. Everybody here thinks of you as the cornerstone of the institution.

Martin: Well, that may be, but you should have seen me in the early years. I was naïve and reckless. I may be more adept at my job now, but I felt inept for years.

Kazuko: I saw you talking with some of the new recruits. What advice did you give them?

Martin: I gave them the same advice that an old hand gave me when I first started: Take every piece of advice you get with a grain of salt!

### 0505 Teaching Children About Safety

Ms. Sanchez: Okay, kids. I’m Ms. Sanchez, your substitute for this week. I’m taking all of you on the field trip tomorrow. Listen up. There are some ground rules we need to go over. First, each of you will have a partner and you will hold hands while we cross the streets.

Student: Ms. Sanchez…?

Ms. Sanchez: I’ll take questions later. Let me get through all of my instructions first. Remember, don’t talk to strangers. There are predators out there who are looking to lure children away from their family and friends and to abduct them, so don’t let your guard down.

Student: Ms. Sanchez…

Ms. Sanchez: As I said, I’ll take questions later. If you need to step away from the group, ask permission first. If a stranger tries to accost or waylay you, run away as fast as you can.

Student: Uh, Ms. Sanchez?

Ms. Sanchez: Yes?

Student: I think you’ve got the wrong classroom. We’re the eighth graders. The first graders are on the second floor.

Ms. Sanchez: Where are my glasses? Oh, here they are. Oh! You’re not my first-graders! Why didn’t anyone say anything earlier?!

### 0506 Being Generous and Stingy

Britney: I was thinking of hitting up Jane for a little loan. You know her better than I do. What are the chances she’ll spot me a couple hundred dollars until next month?

Salvador: I think that’s a pipe dream. I wouldn’t exactly call her a cheapskate, but she’s not known for her generosity.

Britney: What about Francke? He’s rolling in it. He could easily part with a couple hundred bucks without giving it a second thought.

Salvador: You’ve got your work cut out for you if you think you can borrow money from Francke. He’s always been a penny-pincher and he always will be.

Britney: Okay, then help me think. Who do we know who isn’t stingy? Who do we know who is big-hearted and charitable?

Salvador: What the heck. Here’s $150 to tide you over until your next payday.

Britney: Wow, thanks! You know, another $100 would really come in handy.

Salvador: I really think you should quit while you’re ahead.

### 0507 Guarding One’s Privacy

I went to visit my old friend, Mina, whom I hadn’t seen in several years. It was one of the strangest afternoons of my life!

Dan: Hi, Mina, it’s really good to see you.

Mina: Dan, come in. Hurry!

Dan: Uh, okay. Why do you have four locks on your door, and why are all of the curtains drawn?

Mina: I like my privacy. And anyway, I think there’s a peeping Tom around this apartment building and I don’t want him to get a peek into my apartment.

Dan: Oh, okay. I noticed that your name isn’t on your mailbox. I wasn’t sure I had the right apartment number.

Mina: Do you think I would voluntarily give people that information? They are constantly trying to invade my privacy. All I want is anonymity, but I have to be on guard all of the time. These days, I only give out personal information on a need-to-know basis.

Dan: No offense, but isn’t that a little paranoid? You act as though everybody is out to get you.

Mina: Aren’t they? Haven’t you noticed? We constantly have to disclose our most personal information on forms and to anyone who comes to our door. If I didn’t know you were coming today, I wouldn’t have opened my door at all.

Dan: You mean you live here in seclusion, like a hermit?

Mina: Of course not! I have plenty of friends. Come and meet them all.

Dan: Wow, you must have 10 birds and 20 cats!

Mina: Yes, that’s right. But, rest assured, none of them will breathe a word of what you say here today!

### 0508 Regretting Past Actions

Dennis: Oh, why did I let my temper get the best of me? I never should have said those things to the new client!

Nora: Don’t freak out. I’m sure you didn’t do any damage that can’t be rectified. It’s true that, in retrospect, you probably shouldn’t have called Nathan, the head of the project, a twerp.

Dennis: Don’t remind me of what I said! Hindsight is 20/20. Now they’re going to think we’re running a dog and pony show.

Nora: No, they’re not. Nathan was being unreasonable and you tried to sugarcoat your objections the best you could. Everybody could see that you were trying to pull your punches, but that guy just wouldn’t give an inch.

Dennis: Nevertheless, this is going to have repercussions.

Nora: Oh, here comes the boss now. I think she wants to talk to you.

Dennis: I’ve no doubt about that.

Nora: What do you suppose she’s going to say?

Dennis: I know exactly what she’s going to say: “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out!”

### 0509 Going on a Cruise

Connie: I’m so excited! We’re finally taking a cruise. Are you sure this is the embarkation area?

Robert: Yes, I’m sure. We go on board right here, see? Come on, let’s find our cabin.

Connie: Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as possible and look around the entire ship. Do you think they’ll let us go on the bridge and meet the captain?

Robert: I don’t think so. You know, I think we’re going the wrong way. I can’t find our cabin number.

Connie: Let’s see if we can find the purser or a steward to help us. Oh, never mind, here it is! Wow, this cabin is really small.

Robert: No worries. We won’t be spending much time in the cabin. When do we eat?

Connie: We can go down to the buffet right now for lunch, and I put us down for the main seating at 7:00 for dinner.

Robert: Whoa, what’s that?!

Connie: That’s the ship setting sail. You’re not going to be seasick, are you?

Robert: I don’t think so, but I’m really looking forward to our first port of call!

### 0510 Taking a Shower or Bath

I spent the day helping my friend, Babbit, on his farm. When I got home, my wife said, “You stink!” I headed straight for the shower.

I ran the water, closed the shower curtain, and adjusted the showerhead. I worked the soap into a lather and scrubbed from head to toe. I rinsed off the soap and toweled off.

When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “You still stink! You need to soak in a bath!”

I went back into the bathroom, put the stopper in the bathtub, and turned on the faucet. I didn’t want to take any chances. I took some of my wife’s bubble bath and poured it into the bathtub. When the bath was ready, I got in. I soaked for a half hour and I washed every nook and cranny.

When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Wow, you smell as pretty as a flower!” That wasn’t exactly what I was going for, but I’d rather smell like flowers than pigs!

### 0511 Getting Plastic Surgery

George: What are you doing?

Joan: I’m looking through these magazines to try and decide which plastic surgery procedures I should have next year.

George: You’re not thinking of going under the knife.

Joan: Yes, I am. I’ve always wanted to improve on the way I look, and I’m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin. I want to look 25 again!

George: That’s ridiculous. Nobody who is 45 can look 25. People who get Botox, have facelifts, or tummy tucks look weird.

Joan: That’s because they didn’t go to the best plastic surgeons. I won’t make that mistake. Help me decide. Should I get liposuction and a nose job, or should I go all out and get breast implants, too?

George: I think you’ve gone off the deep end. We’ve been friends for over 20 years and you don’t need any cosmetic surgery. You’re perfect the way you are.

Joan: You can’t be serious!

George: I’m dead serious, and if you get all of that plastic surgery, you’ll look like an over-the-hill Barbie doll, and I’m not going to be seen in public with you.

Joan: What’s wrong with a little plastic surgery? I just want to feel better about myself.

George: You don’t need plastic surgery to do that. You just need to spend more time with me and your other friends who like you just the way you are!

Joan: Sagging skin and all?

George: What sagging skin?

Joan: I feel younger already.

### 0512 Changing the Subject in Conversation

Laura: I think that’s all we need to talk about regarding last month’s report. Let’s turn to this month’s report, shall we? I didn’t get a copy of it. Could someone hand me one?

Gaius: By the way, I have just one last comment before we shift our focus to this month’s report. It seems to me that we need more information on how the Duluth office is doing. Could we ask for more info to be included in next month’s report?

Laura: I’m sure we can. Incidentally, Dee is quitting and Kara will be taking her place. This is off the record, of course. Okay, now back to this month’s report…

Gaius: Speaking of personnel changes, did you know that Lee is being promoted to V.P. next month?

Laura: I hadn’t heard that, but I’m not surprised. She’s been in line for that job for years. Okay, we need to get back to this month’s report…

Gaius: Something just occurred to me. If Lee is being promoted, what will happen to the Baseship project?

Laura: I think it’s being put on the back burner for now. All right, could someone hand me a copy of this month’s report?

Gaius: I don’t mean to change the subject but…

Laura: I think that’s precisely what you’re trying to do. What’s the matter with this month’s report?

Gaius: It’s not quite finished. It’ll be on your desk this afternoon.

Laura: Is that what this tap dance has been about? All right, we’ll talk about it at tomorrow’s meeting. Next time, just give it to me straight, okay?

### 0513 Snooping and Eavesdropping

Enrique: I don’t know how you talked me into coming with you to Dan’s apartment to rifle through his papers. This snooping is stupid! If you have suspicions, you should just talk to him.

Stella: Confront him without any evidence? That would be the height of stupidity.

Enrique: Instead, we’re holed up in this closet until he leaves. I thought you said he wouldn’t be home until 6:00.

Stella: That’s what I thought. Just sit tight. I think he just came home to pick something up. He’ll be gone in a minute.

Enrique: I don’t like confined spaces. If we don’t make a break for it soon, I’m going to suffocate.

Stella: Stop your kvetching. Now that we’re here, maybe we can do better than looking through his papers. We can eavesdrop on his conversations.

Enrique: Have you lost your mind? Do you know what he would do to us if he found us here?

Stella: No guts, no glory!

### 0514 Describing Old and New Clothes

Ellen: What are you wearing to the party?

Hiro: Your guess is as good as mine.

Ellen: Let’s look through your closet and I’ll help you pick something out.

Hiro: Okay, but I have to warn you. I have a pretty limited wardrobe.

Ellen: Let’s see, these black pants are nice, but they’re frayed on the bottom. How about these jeans?

Hiro: You don’t think they’re too faded? There’s also a rip in the back.

Ellen: No, I guess those jeans won’t work. I like this shirt, though.

Hiro: Did you see the stain on the front? The zipper is also stuck, I think.

Ellen: How about shoes? Do you have any shoes that are presentable?

Hiro: Well, I always wear these, but they’re scuffed on the top and the sole is pretty worn.

Ellen: Okay, desperate times call for desperate measures. Come on!

Hiro: Where are we going?

Ellen: We’re going to a magical place with brand spanking new clothes and where everything is flawless.

Hiro: Where’s that?

Ellen: The mall!

### 0515 Starting a Blog

I’ve been thinking about starting a blog for a long time now, and after talking to my friend Traver, a popular blogger, I’ve decided to take the leap.

Traver got me started with a basic template, but I wanted to customize the blog to give it my own flavor before launching it. I already have my first few posts ready to go, and I plan to update it a few times a week.

Traver told me that it may take a little time for my blog to catch on and become known in the blogosphere. He suggested I do some basic self-promotion. He told me to register my website with the major search engines and to swap links with other bloggers writing on similar topics. He gave me some other advice to increase hits and I’m taking it all to heart.

I can’t wait to get my first comments and to start talking to other people about our common interest: Our love of cats!

### 0516 Naming and Appointing Officials

Goran: Who do you think will be appointed to succeed Ramon on the board?

Anne: I don’t know whom they’ll pick to fill the position, but I know who the candidates are. The higher ups have been quietly vetting three people to make sure they don’t have any skeletons in their closets.

Goran: Really? Who are they?

Anne: I’m not at liberty to say, but I think at least two of the candidates are people outside of the inner circle.

Goran: You mean we might actually get a new board member who’s not buddy-buddy with the higher ups?

Anne: All I can say is that two outsiders are under consideration.

Goran: Wow, that’s huge. Can you at least tell me if the remaining candidate is the interim board member? Everybody thinks he has the inside track.

Anne: I can’t tell you that. The selection is being kept under wraps until next Thursday. I’ve already let slip too much.

Goran: Don’t worry. My lips are sealed.

Anne: They’d better be. You know what they say about loose lips.

Goran: Yeah, and I’m not sinking this ship.

### 0517 Watching Competitive Sports

Bruno: Hey, what are you doing? Give me back that remote!

Tamara: The movie I want to watch is on right now. Do you mind?

Bruno: Of course I mind! I’m watching the playoffs. Can’t you see that?

Tamara: The playoffs? Oh, I’ll watch with you.

Bruno: You? You don’t know anything about sports.

Tamara: It doesn’t matter. I always root for the underdog. Our team will be victorious! Go team!

Bruno: Fine, but I’m rooting for the other team. Let’s just watch the game, okay?

Tamara: Your team is going to get pounded. We will be the champions!

Bruno: Please, can I just watch this game in peace? I’ve been waiting for it all season.

Tamara: Oooh, somebody is a little testy. I think it’s because you know you’re backing a losing team. You can’t stand being on the losing side. Am I right? Your players are running scared already. I can tell.

Bruno: I’m just trying to follow the game.

Tamara: Look at that! Your best player just choked. How could he have missed such an easy shot?

Bruno: If you don’t be quiet, I’ll show you what it feels like to get choked!

### 0518 Learning Self-Defense

Teacher: Welcome, everybody, to this self-defense class. Today, you’ll learn how to size up a situation and how to tell the difference between a harmless situation and a threatening one. You’ll also begin to learn some hand-to-hand combat moves to defend yourselves.

Amy: Oh, good. I can’t wait to learn some martial arts so I can beat up anyone who tries anything.

Teacher: Well, the best thing we can do in a dangerous situation is to avoid having to fight. It’s not a good idea to confront someone pumped up on adrenaline. If you can defuse the situation or run away, that would be the best strategy.

Amy: All right, but if someone is harassing me, I want to be ready to do some damage.

Teacher: I’m not sure if that’s the right mindset…

Amy: I always trust my instincts. If my intuition tells me that someone may be dangerous, I want to get in the first punch.

Teacher: Whoa, that’s not the purpose of this class. You’re here to learn defense, remember?

Amy: Yes, but you know what they say: The best defense is a good offense!

### 0519 Describing Family Relations

Eri: What’s that?

James: It’s an invitation to a family reunion. Once every five years or so, someone in the family organizes one.

Eri: Are you going?

James: I’m not sure. It’s always a little awkward seeing extended family. Did you know that there used to be a big feud between my father and his brother?

Eri: No, what happened?

James: I’m not sure, but it was something that happened before they got married. My father held a grudge for years. Then, about eight years ago, they made up. There’s still no love lost between their wives, but at least there are no hard feelings between the two of them any longer.

Eri: So you’ll go to the reunion?

James: I’m not sure. My mother’s side of the family has always looked down on my father’s. She comes from old money and they didn’t approve of her marrying my father. It was really hard on my mother. She really looked up to her mother and they were really close before my father came along.

Eri: But that’s ancient history, isn’t it? Considering how things turned out, your grandmother can’t hold it against your mother for marrying your father.

James: You’ve never met my grandmother. One thing everyone knows about her is this: She doesn’t know the words to forgive and forget.

### 0520 Getting Directions and Parking Instructions

Receptionist: So the meeting is set for 2:00 on Thursday. Do you know how to get to our offices?

Asha: No, I don’t. Could you give me directions?

Receptionist: Certainly. We’re located on Main Street. The cross street is Udall. If you’re taking the freeway, the best exit to take is Udall East. Once you’re on Udall, head east for about two miles and when you reach the bend, veer right. If you veer left, you’ll run into a dead end. After you veer right, you’ll be on Monroe Avenue and it’s a one-way street. Our building is on the right-hand side, past the light. If you pass Elm Street, you’ve gone too far.

Asha: Okay, I think I’ve got all that. Is there parking available?

Receptionist: Unfortunately, there’s only street parking. There is valet parking for the building next door, but they charge $12 and we don’t validate. There are meters on the street and on the side streets, but you may need to circle the block a few times to find an available meter.

Asha: All right, and thanks for the information. I guess I need to leave early to have plenty of time to find the building and to find parking.

Receptionist: I tell everybody to count on getting lost and having to hunt for parking.

Asha: Thanks for the heads up!

### 0521 Describing Speech and Language Ability

Blaire: Do you have any idea what he’s saying?

Antonio: It’s Greek to me. You’re supposed to be the one who’s fluent. Can’t you make out what he’s saying?

Blaire: I never said I was fluent. I said I could get by in the language. There’s a big difference.

Antonio: Why don’t you try saying something to him?

Blaire: What should I say?

Antonio: How about, “I don’t have a good command of the language. Could you please speak more slowly?”

Blaire: I don’t think speaking more slowing will help my comprehension. Besides, I only know a few stock phrases, and even those I can only say haltingly, if I don’t freeze up altogether.

Antonio: Give me the phrase book. I’ll see if I can get through to him.

Blaire: What are you going to say?

Antonio: I don’t know, but we’re two fairly articulate people. We should be able to cobble together a few sentences to get our point across, don’t you think?

Blaire: Okay, I’ll follow your lead, but, um, just don’t say anything insulting…like last time.

Antonio: Are you bringing that up again?! It’s not my fault that the entire town misinterpreted what I said! I was trying to compliment the women, not insult them.

Blaire: Tell that to the men who ran you out of town!

### 0522 Developing a Healthy Mind

Lorelai: I just finished reading a book about how to get the most out of life. Starting today, I’m going to live life to its fullest.

Luke: Oh no, not another one of your fads. Weren’t you eating only blue- and red-colored foods a couple of months ago?

Lorelai: This is not a fad! I’m changing my lifestyle so I’ll be able to live a happier and more fulfilling life.

Luke: And didn’t you go through a phase where you spoke only to animals?

Lorelai: I’m not listening to you, and I’m not dwelling on the past. I’m living in the moment and enjoying everything around me. I’m ignoring your negativity and concentrating on appreciating the moment.

Luke: What are you doing now?

Lorelai: I’m practicing mindfulness. I’m repeating my mantra and calming my mind. You should try meditation. It may help you with your problems.

Luke: What problems?

Lorelai: We could start with your judgmental attitude and your close-mindedness. How’s that?

Luke: Forget it! Nothing can get me to buy your latest hocus pocus!

### 0523 Having Trouble Making a Decision

Lorenzo: Have you bought a new television yet?

Katia: No, I’m still looking at consumer reviews and weighing my options. I’m not sure yet what size I want or what features I need. I’m keeping my options open for now.

Lorenzo: I thought your old TV stopped working three weeks ago. You still haven’t made up your mind about buying a new one?

Katia: Oh, I’ve decided to buy a new one. It’s which one I’m going to buy that’s making me hesitate. There are so many options to choose from. I want to approach this logically and decide only after I’ve done the proper analysis.

Lorenzo: It’s only a TV. It’s not like it’s a house or even a car.

Katia: I know, but I’m the one who has to live with the decision. I’ll look at it every day, and if I don’t make the right decision, it’ll haunt me for years.

Lorenzo: You know what I think?

Katia: What?

Lorenzo: I think you’re crippled by indecision, and you’re stalling. The sooner you make a decision and buy a new TV, the better.

Katia: Hey, what are you doing? Where are you taking me?

Lorenzo: We’re going to the electronics store this minute, and you’re buying a TV – today!

Katia: What if I regret my decision?

Lorenzo: Then I’ll buy you a new one.

Katia: Fine, but I’m holding you to that!

### 0524 Talking About Failure

Akiko: How did your presentation go over this morning at the meeting?

Gerry: It was a complete flop!

Akiko: I don’t believe it. You spent weeks working on that presentation.

Gerry: It wasn’t the presentation that bombed. It was my big idea. Leona called it a retread of what I presented last year, and she was not in the least impressed.

Akiko: Ouch, that’s pretty harsh. What did the others say?

Gerry: Overall, the response was dismal. Everyone else was trying to be tactful, but it boiled down to the fact that they thought it was pathetic.

Akiko: I’m sure that’s not true. And if they didn’t jump up and down about the idea right away, they’re bound to come around after you give them more details.

Gerry: I don’t know…

Akiko: Come on, aren’t you the same guy who told me that you didn’t know the meaning of the word “quit”?

Gerry: That was before this morning’s presentation.

Akiko: Are you giving up on your great idea?

Gerry: No, I guess not, but it’ll take some reworking…

Akiko: Good, then you won’t give up?

Gerry: I guess not. What the heck? I’m only risking more humiliation and failure, right?

Akiko: That’s the spirit!

### 0525 Falling in Love

Maya: What are those?

Jorge: They’re pictures from our ski trip last weekend.

Maya: Is there any reason you’re staring at the ones with Jessica in them? I think you’ve got a crush on her.

Jorge: I’m not 10 years old. I don’t get crushes.

Maya: Then, I think you’re falling head over heels for her.

Jorge: Don’t be ridiculous. I’ve only just met her.

Maya: I knew it was love at first sight when I introduced you at Yannick’s party. I could see the sparks fly. I couldn’t miss her blush or your silly grin. There was certainly a lot of chemistry between the two of you, that’s for sure.

Jorge: I hardly talked to her at the party.

Maya: Yes, but I could see her stealing glances at you all night.

Jorge: That must have been a figment of your imagination.

Maya: Oh, really?

Jorge: Okay, I won’t deny that I’m attracted to Jessica, but I can’t speak for her.

Maya: Yes, but I can.

Jorge: What?

Maya: She asked me about you.

Jorge: When?

Maya: Yesterday, at lunch.

Jorge: What did she say? What did you say?

Maya: That’s for me to know and for you to find out!

### 0526 Talking About Age

Gabby: Another birthday! I’m going to stop celebrating. What’s there to celebrate – getting old and decrepit?

Cherif: Are you kidding me? We’re in the prime of our lives. Who’s decrepit? I’m not.

Gabby: If I’m in my prime, then why do I feel so middle age?

Cherif: It’s a matter of perspective. It’s true that we’re not spring chickens anymore, but who wants all of the angst of youth? Not me. I like living these mature years without the insecurity and uncertainty of youth.

Gabby: It’s not that. I don’t miss the awkwardness of my teenage years, and I definitely don’t miss the struggles I had to go through in my 20s. What I miss is the excitement of seeing and experiencing things for the first time. If I’m nostalgic, then I’m nostalgic for the innocence of youth.

Cherif: Come on. There’s nothing stopping you from seeing and trying new things now. Don’t tell me that you’ve seen and done everything.

Gabby: No, I haven’t.

Cherif: Then you’ll come with me next Saturday, and I guarantee you a new experience.

Gabby: What new experience?

Cherif: Have you ever tried skydiving?

Gabby: No, I haven’t and I don’t plan to now. I may be old, but I’m not ready to kick the bucket yet!

### 0527 Describing Men’s Bodies

Justin: What are you ogling at?

Katrina: I’m watching those guys working across the street.

Justin: Those construction workers?

Katrina: Yeah, those prime examples of manhood. There’s not a flabby gut in the bunch.

Justin: I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t appreciate you watching them as though they were pieces of meat. Hasn’t anyone ever told you not to objectify the opposite sex?

Katrina: What? I’m not objectifying anybody. I’m just admiring their six-packs and guns. Look at those long, lean bodies.

Justin: Stop it! It’s demeaning, and on behalf of all men out there, I’m really offended. It’s disgusting.

Katrina: Is it disgusting to have a picture of Megan Fox on the wall in your office?

Justin: That’s different!

Katrina: How?

Justin: It’s her personality I admire.

Katrina: You could’ve fooled me.

### 0528 Negotiating Salary

Renaldo: Hello, may I speak to Simone Otto?

Simone: This is Simone. May I ask who’s calling?

Renaldo: This is Renaldo Garcia at Cinetect. You interviewed for a position with me last week.

Simone: Oh, yes, of course. How are you?

Renaldo: I’m doing well. The reason I’m calling is that I was very impressed with you last week, and I’d like to offer you the job.

Simone: Thank you very much. I’m delighted to hear it. I really appreciate the job offer.

Renaldo: I think we now need to talk about salary. What are your salary requirements?

Simone: Well, for this type of position, I would be looking for a salary range between $60,000 and $65,000.

Renaldo: Hmm, that’s a bit higher than I was thinking, given our budget constraints. Perhaps we can give you an attractive compensation package if the salary isn’t quite what you’re looking for.

Simone: I’m certainly open to negotiations, though I think that the salary range I named is comparable to that of similar positions in the field.

Renaldo: All right. Why don’t you consider this: I can give you a salary of $50,000 and I’ll increase your annual vacation time from two weeks to three weeks.

Simone: Hmm, I’ll need to think about that…

Renaldo: In this economy, it’s a salary that many people would jump at.

Simone: I understand that, but I also know that I have a lot to offer your company.

Renaldo: That’s certainly true, and I don’t you to walk away from this job if there’s any way we can close the gap in salary.

Simone: If you’re willing to up the offer to $60,000, then I think it may be doable.

Renaldo: Well, $60,000 is really the ceiling for that position. I’ll have to give it some thought and call you back.

Simone: Please do, and again, thank you very much for the offer. It would be an honor to work with you and to work at Cinetect.

### 0529 Insulting Other People

Lourdes: Do you see those teenagers over there? They’re making trouble again.

Nick: Those kids are just messing around. When they get bored, they’ll pipe down and go home.

Lourdes: They’re really getting on my nerves, playing loud music and making all that noise. They’re a disgrace.

Nick: Get away from that window before they see you. If they see that they can’t get a rise out of us, they’ll move along. What are you doing? What are you planning to do with that broom?

Lourdes: I’m going to use it to wave them off.

Nick: I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Teenagers can be unpredictable. You don’t know if a small slight might set them off. Insult them and you’re asking for trouble.

Lourdes: I don’t care. I’m doing it anyway.

Nick: Great! Now you have their attention. They’re flipping us off!

Lourdes: Yeah, well, two can play that game. Take that!

Nick: Are you crazy?!

Lourdes: No, I’m just giving as good as I get. Look what they’re doing now!

Nick: They’re mooning us!

Lourdes: Well, two can play that game, too!

Nick: What?! Are you nuts?! You can’t moon them back.

Lourdes: Oh, no? Watch me!

### 0530 Exterior Parts of a Car

Ethan: You missed a spot.

Marie: Hold on. When we made our bet for the loser to wash the winner’s car, it didn’t include the other person being there and being a pain in the neck.

Ethan: I’m just here to make sure everything gets washed properly, from the hood to the taillights.

Marie: Don’t you worry. See how carefully I’m washing the windshield, side mirrors, and headlights? I bet they’ve never been cleaner.

Ethan: When are you going to get to the tires and the hubcaps? And I think you forgot the tailpipe.

Marie: Will you get lost? I’ll do a better job without you looking over my shoulder.

Ethan: I doubt that. If I weren’t here, who would remind you to clean the roof rack and the windshield wipers? I bet you would have forgotten those, for sure.

Marie: I’m going to forget about this whole thing if you don’t shut up.

Ethan: Nah uh. That’s not an option. When you lose a bet, you have to pay the price.

Marie: Well, I’m willing to be a graceful loser if you’ll stop gloating.

Ethan: Not a chance! Don’t forget the grills!

### 0531 Describing Fabric Patterns

Ruth: Now that we’ve picked out a new couch, we need to pick out an upholstery fabric. What do you think of this checkered one?

Gerry: That’s an eyesore. I prefer something a little more subtle.

Ruth: Subtle? What’s fun about subtle? I want something bold and that’ll make a statement. How about this one with the polka dots?

Gerry: You’ve got to be kidding! That pattern is so busy, if I had to look at that every day, I’d go crazy.

Ruth: All right, what do you think of this one with the stripes?

Gerry: I’m not crazy about it, but it’s not as tacky as the others ones.

Ruth: Okay then, you pick one out.

Gerry: Fine. Let me see…Now this is a sight for sore eyes!

Ruth: But that has no pattern at all! It’s a solid blue color, and a boring shade of blue to boot.

Gerry: That’s right. That’s what I call a classic.

Ruth: And that’s what I call dull!

### 0532 Using an Online Email Program

Luigi: What do you think of this new email program?

Selma: I don’t know yet. I just started using it. The interface is pretty intuitive, but I haven’t figured out how to sort my inbox by date.

Luigi: That’s easy. Let me show you. All you have to do is hit one of these buttons and it’ll sort automatically.

Selma: Oh, I see. Let me try to compose a message. I’ll cc: myself and I’ll bcc: you to make sure it goes through. It looks like if I don’t want to send it right away, I can save the message as a draft. If I do send it, does it save a copy?

Luigi: Yes, it should. Refresh the page and it should show up in “sent mail.”

Selma: Oh, yeah, there it is. Let’s see, I can also archive messages or mark them as junk or send them straight to trash. How do I add contacts?

Luigi: You can put contacts into your address book by dragging an email address into your “contacts” folder, like this.

Selma: Okay, one more thing: I want to set up spam filters and some other filters to block unwanted emails.

Luigi: You can do that in this window, see? Whose emails are you blocking?

Selma: Yours, if don’t stop forwarding all of those stupid jokes every day.

Luigi: And deprive you of the fun? Never!

### 0533 Making Funeral and Burial Arrangements

Reiko: When I die, I want a big funeral. The more mourners the better!

Lucas: Not me. I’m just the opposite. I don’t want any kind of funeral or wake. I just want to be cremated and have my ashes scattered.

Reiko: What? You don’t want to be buried in a beautiful casket with a big headstone? Better yet, how about being interred in a mausoleum?

Lucas: You’ve got to be kidding me! Why would I all want all of that hoopla? I’m dead. What difference would it make to me?

Reiko: It’s not for you. It’s for the mourners. Having a ceremony and a burial will help them grieve.

Lucas: Not my friends and family. The less fuss the better for them. Most of my family is buried in simple gravesites in non-denominational cemeteries.

Reiko: What’s the fun in that?

Lucas: I think you’re forgetting one thing: we’re talking about death. It’s not supposed to be fun and games!

### 0534 Types of Guns and Weapons

Bobbie: I’ve always pegged you as the non-violent type. What’s with your fascination with guns and that sort of thing?

Emmanuel: I come from a long line of military officers and I grew up with all of it. Believe it or not, I learned how to fire pistols and rifles before I was 10 years old, and by the time I was 14, I was a pretty good shot.

Bobbie: I hope you fired at targets and not at people.

Emmanuel: No, not people. We did do some hunting when I was young, but I mainly honed my skills with target practice.

Bobbie: I’d like to try target practice – with a machine gun or a grenade launcher! I’m sure I’d at least hit something.

Emmanuel: Yeah, right. What really interests me are the big weapons, like missiles – you know, like antiballistic missiles and torpedoes.

Bobbie: You can have all of the missiles you want. I’ll be hiding in the tank!

### 0535 Describing Speed and Pace

Chiu: Come on, slowpoke, hurry up! We’ll never get to the top of the hill if you don’t get a move on.

Sarah: There’s no way you’re going to get me to move at breakneck speed. I’ve gone up at least 500 steps already, and my legs are about to fall off. Tell me again why we’re trudging up this hill?

Chiu: It’s the only way to the ruins and the view from there will really be worth your while. Trust me. Pick up the pace or we won’t get there before sunset!

Sarah: It’s not like I’m dawdling here. I may be moving at a snail’s pace, but this is as fast as I can manage without keeling over. If you’re in such a hurry, you can sprint up there by yourself. Go ahead. Impress me with your blinding speed.

Chiu: I’m not about to leave you here all by yourself.

Sarah: Why? Do you feel sorry for me?

Chiu: Yes, I always feel sorry for the physically challenged.

Sarah: Oh, yeah? Better physically challenged than mentally challenged!

### 0536 Using a Computer Keyboard

Leslie: This keyboard is so hard to use. I can’t find where anything is!

Dave: It’s a standard QWERTY keyboard. The layout may be a little different, with the function keys on the right-hand side instead of on the top, but you’ll get used to it in no time.

Leslie: That’s what you think. I don’t need an ergonomic wireless keyboard. I liked my old one.

Dave: Everybody in the office is getting one, so you weren’t singled out. Okay, let me give you a quick orientation. The keyboard has a built-in number pad, and all you need to do is press the “num lock” key to use it. The escape (“esc”) key is over here, and the “control,” “alt,” and “shift” keys are on the bottom.

Leslie: Where’s the “caps lock”?

Dave: It’s on your left.

Leslie: But my old keyboard had a bunch of hotkeys. What am I supposed to do without them?

Dave: You can program your function keys to act as hotkeys. Do you want me to show you how to do that?

Leslie: I guess so. Since I’m stuck with this keyboard, I guess I have to live with it.

Dave: That’s the spirit!

### 0537 Types of Bank Accounts

Luiz: Where are you going?

Iona: I’m going to the bank to open an account.

Luiz: What kind of account: a savings account, a checking account, or a CD?

Iona: Um, I’m not sure, but I’m sure someone at the bank can help me decide.

Luiz: You’ll also need to decide if you want an interest-earning account or not, and don’t forget to ask for free checking. Pick a bank that doesn’t have monthly service charges.

Iona: Okay, thanks…

Luiz: And make sure you know if there’s a minimum balance required, because if the account dips below that minimum, you’ll be charged a fee.

Iona: Yes, right, I’ll be sure to do that. Well, I’d better get going…

Luiz: You probably want to open a checking and a savings account, so make sure you link those accounts. That should give you overdraft protection, in case you ever bounce a check.

Iona: Okay, I’ll definitely keep all of that in mind. I’d better go. Samil is waiting for me.

Luiz: Are you thinking of opening a joint account with your boyfriend?

Iona: We’re considering it…

Luiz: Pool your money and open a CD. That way, you’ll lock in a good interest rate and neither of you can touch the money until the CD matures.

Iona: We’ll think about it. Thanks.

Luiz: Oh, and…

Iona: Would you like to come with us to the bank and help us open our accounts?

Luiz: Really? But I don’t want to interfere.

Iona: You, interfere? I can’t imagine you ever trying to interfere.

### 0538 Finding the Perfect Gift

Fae: Help! I still need to buy a gift for my mother and I can’t seem to think of the perfect present, something that’ll really knock her socks off.

Pablo: Why don’t you just get her a gift certificate or a gift card? That way, she can pick out her own gift.

Fae: Oh, she would hate that. She would think that I didn’t put any thought into buying her a present at all, while I’ve been racking my brain to think of something she’ll like. Maybe I should buy her a car!

Pablo: Now, don’t get carried away. You get like this every year. I know you want to please your mother, but remember, it’s the thought that counts.

Fae: I wish that were true. If I get her the wrong gift, I’m afraid she’ll be disappointed, or worse, she’ll hold it against me for the rest of my life.

Pablo: It boggles my mind how you can work yourself up like this every year.

Fae: How can I not? You know my mother.

Pablo: Yes, I do, and I have one piece of advice for you: Buy her a gift she can return.

### 0539 Spending Time with Family

Claus: Go home. You need to spend more time with your loved ones before they report you missing.

Marcia: This is the busy season. Do you think I have time to stop to smell the roses when I have work coming out of my ears?

Claus: It’s true we’re busy, but you get too wrapped up in your work. How old are your daughters?

Marcia: They’re six and nine.

Claus: Right. Before you know it, they’ll be grown and you’ll have missed out on their childhood. Take it from someone who knows. Don’t take your family for granted.

Marcia: I know you’re right. I need to spend more quality time with them – just as soon as the busy season is over.

Claus: Time slips by while you’re not paying attention. Look at me. I worked my butt off to get where I am now, but at what cost? My wife and I are practically strangers and I barely know my children. You don’t want to end up like me.

Marcia: So I should see you as a cautionary tale?

Claus: Yup. Consider this a public service announcement.

### 0540 Promoting a New Product

Zoila: I haven’t seen you around lately. What have you been up to?

Leo: My business partners and I have been putting the final touches on our new line of energy drinks.

Zoila: Really? I didn’t even know that you were in the beverage business.

Leo: Yeah, we’ve branched out into a few other areas. We’re going to start promoting the new drinks very soon. We’re working with an advertising agency and we’ll start with sponsoring a couple of sporting events.

Zoila: Wow, when am I going to start seeing ads on TV?

Leo: I don’t think we’re going to go that route just yet.

Zoila: Are you taking the new products to trade shows?

Leo: No, no trade shows for us. We’re working on product placement in some music videos and maybe a TV show or two.

Zoila: That’s great. What about tie-ins with other products or with a movie? I see those everywhere.

Leo: We’re considering it. We’re working on a couple of endorsement deals right now. Once we have some celebrities on board, we’ll do even more.

Zoila: It would be great if you could get Jeff McQuillan to endorse your products. Everybody knows he’s the greatest baseball player who ever lived. With him plugging your energy drinks, sales will go through the roof.

Leo: Yeah, but I think we’d be shooting too high. We might have to settle for someone a little less famous – like David Beckham or Lance Armstrong.

### 0541 Reporting the News

I have always wanted to be a news reporter. When I was about 10 years old, I would write my own news stories and publish them in my own newspaper. In reality, the newspaper was just a piece of paper on which I’d written my stories and drew my pictures, but it was my first taste of the power of the press.

When I got to college, I worked on the university newspaper and started out as a copy editor, editing stories and writing headlines. Then, I began to cover news events, getting my first bylines. I can’t tell you how excited I was to see my name in print for the first time!

Since then, I’ve worked at several newspapers. I started out at the bottom, writing obituaries and news briefs. Then, I got a regular beat and wrote some features and investigative reports. I’ve even written the occasional editorial.

What next? You never know in the newspaper business, but I’m shooting for a Pulitzer!

### 0542 Renting a Movie

Brenda: I have to return these movies in the drop box today or I’ll have late fees. Can I get you anything while I’m out?

Jang: Are you still renting movies from the video store? I use a service that delivers the movies to my mailbox. There are never any late fees.

Brenda: I’ve thought about subscribing to one of those services, but I think I would really miss browsing at the video store. I like checking out the new releases and staff picks, and you never know what you’ll find to buy in the bargain bins.

Jang: Renting movies online is so much quicker and easier. I can browse the titles quickly, read the descriptions, read reviews, and sometimes even watch a trailer. Then, all I need to do is put the movie in my queue, and as soon as I mail one movie back, they send me another one. It’s that simple.

Brenda: It does sound easy, but not everything that’s easy is better. Some of us like to take our time to make our selections.

Jang: Whatever. If you want to spend your time looking for movies rather than watching them, that’s your prerogative.

Brenda: Are you really going to let me off so easily? I thought I was in for another one of your lectures.

Jang: You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.

### 0543 Describing Different Smells

Giles: Do you really think we’ll be able to renovate this place and turn it into a restaurant?

Julia: It’s not so bad. I know it smells a little stale and musty in here, but all we need to do is air it out.

Giles: Air it out? This place needs a lot more than an airing out. The kitchen smells putrid. I wonder what died in there.

Julia: There is a faint smell of something nasty in there, but I don’t think it permeates through the rest of the building, do you?

Giles: No, but there are different nasty smells in other parts of the building. Oh! There’s a really strong burnt, smoky smell in this corner. Hold your breath!

Julia: This is a restaurant. I’m sure a thorough cleaning will make all the difference.

Giles: That might be true for the kitchen, but what will you do in the dining room? An entire truckload of scented candles or bottles of perfume couldn’t mask those foul smells. This place just stinks, from top to bottom!

Julia: All right, I’ll look for another building, but this place is cheap and within our budget.

Giles: Yes, but if I had to work here, I’d first have to lose my sense of smell!

### 0544 Working from a Home Office

Adrina: So this is your new home office. It’s nice.

Victor: It’s functional, and I like it. When my company decided to lower its overhead by decentralizing, it gave employees the option to work from home. When I heard that, I didn’t think twice about making the change.

Adrina: I’m not surprised. Lots of people would kill to work from home. Did you have to get dedicated phone and fax lines?

Victor: No, I already have a company cell phone, and I mainly use email to communicate with the office.

Adrina: I assume you get to set your own schedule. Do you find it hard to concentrate on your work? I know I’d be distracted all the time if I had a home office.

Victor: It’s true that there are a lot more distractions at home, but I try to block them out. For me, it’s not getting down to work that’s a problem, it’s getting myself to stop thinking about work all the time! That’s one of the drawbacks of working where you live. I’m more productive, but I’m also more work-centered.

Adrina: I can see that, though I’d still take working from home over working at the office any day.

Victor: I thought you had a home office for your real estate business.

Adrina: I do, but it’s not very conducive to getting any work done.

Victor: Why’s that?

Adrina: My home office doubles as the guestroom and the kids’ playroom!

### 0545 Getting Around Without a Car

Caitland: How are you planning on getting to school and to your job without a car?

Bruno: I’ve got it covered. I have my skateboard.

Caitland: Your skateboard won’t be any use on those dirt roads.

Bruno: No big thing. I’ll just take my bike.

Caitland: Your bike was stolen, along with your rollerblades, remember?

Bruno: Oh, yeah. Maybe I’ll save up and buy a Segway.

Caitland: Those things are really expensive. What’ll you do in the meantime?

Bruno: Maybe I’ll take the bus. Worst case scenario, I give myself more time and I walk. Why are you so interested in how I’m going to commute? Fess up.

Caitland: I care about your well-being, that’s all.

Bruno: Oh, yeah? I don’t buy it. There’s got to be an ulterior motive.

Caitland: Well, I do have an old scooter that would be just what you need to get back and forth from school and work. It uses very little gas and I’ll let you have it for next to nothing.

Bruno: I knew it. You’re trying to pawn off that old scooter on me. Forget it!

Caitland: I’m just looking out for your best interest, that’s all.

Bruno: Isn’t that what all con artists say?

### 0546 Having an Open House

Kyoko: We’re not supposed to be here. I think we should leave and let our real estate agent hold the open house without us looking over her shoulder.

Ernie: We’re not looking over her shoulder. I just want to sit in this car to see how many people go in and out.

Kyoko: You know, there’ll be a lot of lookie-loos. And plus, there’ll be a sign-in sheet, so we’ll be able to see afterwards how many people stopped in.

Ernie: Hey, someone’s coming in now.

Kyoko: That’s the stager. She’s making some last-minute changes.

Ernie: She really doesn’t need to do anything else. We did everything our agent told us to do. We made cosmetic repairs, painted, and de-cluttered. What more could they ask for?

Kyoko: She’s just doing some minor landscaping, putting some plants along the front path and around the front door. Let’s get out of here before people start showing up. I don’t want to seem like I’m spying on my own house.

Ernie: What does it matter? Hand me the fact sheet for our house. I want to read it through again to make sure the agent didn’t miss anything. Okay, the square footage on the house and the lot are correct, she noted that our addition is permitted, and she mentioned the upgrades – good. Where are you going?

Kyoko: I’m not going to sit in this car for the next four hours. Let’s go to visit our neighbors’ open houses.

Ernie: Good idea. We’ll see what our competition is and maybe we can steal some of their open house ideas!

### 0547 Shopping for a Hat

Christine: What do you think of this one?

Eric: We’re here to buy hats to protect us from the sun while we’re on vacation. Do you think a beret will do that?

Christine: No, but it looks great on me, don’t you think? Isn’t it great to be getting away to the beach in the middle of winter! I already picked out a straw hat with a wide, floppy brim, so I’m all set for the trip.

Eric: In that case, help me pick one out. How about this baseball cap?

Christine: Well, the brim gives your face plenty of shade, but it leaves the back of your head exposed. How about this helmet?

Eric: Very funny. Do you want me to suffocate in this thing? Okay, hand me that cowboy hat.

Christine: That looks cute on you, but it’s huge and it’s going to get squished in the luggage. Hey, try these two hats on!

Eric: Stop messing around. I don’t need a top hat, and that one looks like a bonnet!

Christine: Okay, okay, how about this straw hat? Like mine, it’s soft enough to travel in a suitcase.

Eric: Hey, this one isn’t bad. How do I look?

Christine: Just like the tourist that you are, but that makes two of us.

Eric: I couldn’t care less. I don’t care if I look cool on vacation as long as I am cool!

### 0548 Working for an Impossible Boss

Mr. Mann: Why are all these people milling around doing no work? Laura! You’re in charge when I’m out of the office and you’re incompetent!

Laura: Mr. Mann, we need to talk in private. Let’s go into your office.

Mr. Mann: What is this about?

Laura: Mr. Mann, I’ve tried to do my job the best I can, but I won’t tolerate your verbal abuse any longer.

Mr. Mann: Verbal abuse?! I’m just telling it like it is. It’s my…it’s my…management style. This is business. If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

Laura: If I thought this was about my performance, I would certainly take any constructive criticism, but this is really about your inappropriate behavior.

Mr. Mann: What inappropriate behavior? You’re questioning my behavior?

Laura: Yes, I’ve held my tongue long enough. Every day, you come back to the office tipsy from a three-martini lunch, and you go off on me in front of the other employees. That undermines my authority and puts me in an impossible position.

Mr. Mann: I’m your boss and you have no right to question the way I run this house…I mean, department.

Laura: With all due respect, this is no way to run a department.

Mr. Mann: And how dare you suggest that I’m drunk? You don’t know who you’re dealing with.

Laura: Oh, yes I do. You’re my ex-boss. I’ve had enough. I quit!

### 0549 Using a Camera

Ingrid: I don’t mind lending you my camera for the trip, but first, let me show you how to use it.

Deng: No need to do that. I took a photography class in high school, and I pretty much know all there is to know about taking pictures.

Ingrid: Wasn’t that a long time ago? This is a digital camera with some new features. For instance, this camera has auto zoom, image stabilization, and a memory card.

Deng: It can’t be that different from the camera I used 15 years ago. This looks like a point-and-shoot. You look through the viewer and push the button, right?

Ingrid: Well, not quite. You can adjust the flash and shutter speed, see? You can also attach a lens for wide-angle or close-up shots. You can even review your photos, saving the ones you like or deleting the ones you don’t want anymore.

Deng: Okay, I got it. By the way you’re talking, you’d think I was born yesterday. Just show me where to load the film!

### 0550 Differences in Male and Female Friendships

Lauren: Did you see what Stephanie was wearing? She looked like a wet dog!

Quentin: Why do women do that?

Lauren: Do what?

Quentin: Why do women put other women down? Is it to make themselves feel superior?

Lauren: It was only a joke. I didn’t mean anything by it.

Quentin: Do you really think she would find it funny if she had heard you?

Lauren: What about you men? You guys are always bantering and trying to one-up each other. Aren’t you guys trying to see who’s superior and who’s inferior?

Quentin: Women are catty and talk behind each other’s backs. We men make fun of each other in a good-natured way while we’re together. That’s the difference: You women are laughing at each other and we men are laughing with each other.

Lauren: Oh yeah? Was Tim laughing with you guys when you threw him into the lake last weekend?

Quentin: That was very funny, and yes, he thought it was funny, too. What you women don’t understand is that we give as good as we get. Next time, Tim will play a trick on someone else.

Lauren: So it’s a vicious cycle of pranks.

Quentin: Yeah, you could say that. That’s how men bond. That’s something you women don’t seem to understand.

Lauren: We understand, all right. You take turns torturing each other and call it male bonding.

Quentin: See what I mean? You women stick to your ways and we’ll stick to ours.

### 0551 Scheduling a Medical Appointment

I needed to make an appointment with a doctor so I called my health plan’s phone number for new patients. Before I could schedule my appointment, I had to listen to several recorded messages to be routed to the right medical office. The recording said to stay on the line for assistance.

Clerk: Hello, Western Medical Group.

Damien: Hello, I’d like to make an appointment with Dr. Gupta.

Clerk: Are you a new patient or a returning patient?

Damien: I’m a new patient.

Clerk: Who referred you to Dr. Gupta?

Damien: No one. One of the health benefits of my plan is that I can self-refer to some specialists.

Clerk: What is the name of your plan and your medical record number?

Damien: It’s Waiser and my medical record number is 23456789.

Clerk: It looks like Dr. Gupta is booked up for the next three weeks. She has an opening on March 2nd, at 4:30 p.m.

Damien: I was hoping to get an early morning appointment.

Clerk: The next morning appointment won’t be until March 18th, at 11:00. You’ll need to check in at 10:45 to fill out paperwork. Should I put you down for that?

Damien: Is it possible to get an even earlier appointment?

Clerk: Dr. Gupta doesn’t begin seeing patients until 10:30.

Damien: 10:30? Isn’t that pretty late?

Clerk: Dr. Gupta likes to play golf in the mornings.

Damien: Why do you think I want an early morning appointment? Doesn’t she know that some of her patients prefer late-morning golf?

### 0552 Reviewing Job Applications

Missy: Okay, let’s sort this stack of applications into three piles: good candidates, those worth a second look, and definite “no’s.”

Jonathan: Well, that didn’t take long. With this poor economy, I thought we’d get an embarrassment of riches, but these applications are pretty pathetic. I only see two of these people as employee material.

Missy: Yeah, well, it might have something to do with the salary we’re offering. Not everybody is willing to work for peanuts.

Jonathan: Isn’t that the truth! Some of these applicants have never held down a job before and don’t have a single reference. These others don’t seem to be able to hold on to a job, job-hopping every few months.

Missy: Well, at least we have these two standouts. They both have the right educational background and level of experience. Should we call them in for interviews?

Jonathan: Yeah, and I hope they haven’t already been snatched up by another company.

Missy: You and me, both.

### 0553 A Homeowners’ Association

Cuca: What possessed you to agree to become the head of the homeowners’ association?

Emiliano: I’m just tired of all of the waste and not having a say. Our dues keep going up and there seems to be special assessments every year. I’m not even sure the association is following the bylaws anymore. I just felt I had to step up.

Cuca: That’s really admirable, but I hope you know what you’re getting into. There’s been a lot of mismanagement, and you’ll have to do battle with some entrenched members. They’re not going to look kindly on the tough questions you’ll be asking.

Emiliano: Believe me, I’m not looking forward to it, but it’s got to be done.

Cuca: Talk about a thankless job.

Emiliano: Don’t I know it. I guess I’m just a glutton for punishment!

### 0554 An Emergency Airplane Landing

I was nearly asleep in my seat when I heard this announcement:

“Folks, this is the captain speaking from the cockpit. We are experiencing a lot of turbulence and I’m turning on the fasten seatbelt sign. Please remain in your seats.”

I didn’t think anything of it until a few minutes later when I heard this announcement:

“This is your captain speaking again. Due to extreme weather conditions, we may need to make an emergency landing. The cabin crew will review the emergency procedures, and give you instructions on how to use the floatation devices and the oxygen masks. Please stay calm.”

This is when I started to freak out. What if we crash-land? What if we dive into the ocean? Who would rescue us here in the middle of nowhere?

Then, I heard this announcement:

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain again. It seems that we had an instrument malfunction, and no emergency landing will be necessary. Sorry to alarm you, and please go back to sleep.”

Go back to sleep?! Is he kidding? How can anyone sleep after that?! I’m still watching my life flash before my eyes!

### 0555 Lying and Telling the Truth

Elizabeth: You’re full of it!

Leo: I’m telling you the God’s honest truth. Why would I eat the last piece of cake when I know that you had your heart set on it?

Elizabeth: That’s the question, isn’t it? Why would you go behind my back and eat it, and then try to put one over on me?

Leo: Would I be able to look you in the eye if I were lying? Look at me. I’m the picture of Honest Abe.

Elizabeth: Do you expect me to believe that?

Leo: There’s not a dishonest bone in my body. I may tell a white lie here and there, but I would never try to tell you a bald-faced lie like this.

Elizabeth: Oh, really? Do you swear?

Leo: I swear that I didn’t eat the last piece of cake.

Elizabeth: There’s something fishy about the way you said that.

Leo: I don’t know what you mean.

Elizabeth: You didn’t eat the last piece of cake, but you know who did.

Leo: I’m pleading the Fifth.

Elizabeth: Spill it, Abe!

Leo: Not on your life!

### 0556 Scheduling an Appointment

Ann: Hello.

Serge: Hi, Ann. It’s Serge. I’m calling to make an appointment for LeeAnn. She wants to meet with Miles next week sometime.

Ann: Let me take a look at his appointment schedule. Let’s see, can LeeAnn be here on Tuesday at 2:00?

Serge: No, she’s tied up all Tuesday afternoon, but I could shuffle around some of her commitments to free her up on Tuesday morning, if that helps.

Ann: Unfortunately, Tuesday morning is out. I could bump someone on Wednesday afternoon at 3:00. Can LeeAnn be here at that time?

Serge: She has an appointment at 2:30 in this office, but it shouldn’t last more than a half hour. She should be able to make it by 3:00 if she’s not running late. Better yet, I may be able to finagle something, maybe push back that appointment until she gets back to the office. Why don’t you pencil her in for now?

Ann: Okay, I’ll do that, but can you confirm with me by Monday?

Serge: Sure, I’ll give you a heads up no later than noon on Monday if I can’t push back her other appointment.

Ann: Okay, sounds good. Tell me, do you ever feel like we’re spinning our wheels, spending our days making, changing, and canceling appointments?

Serge: Yeah, every single day!

### 0557 Applying for a Passport

Clerk: Yes, can I help you?

Orlando: I want to get a passport.

Clerk: Have you filled out the application?

Orlando: No, I haven’t.

Clerk: Come back when you’ve filled it out.

Orlando: Okay, I’ve completed the application.

Clerk: Let me see it. You need to fill in your Social Security number here and you need to provide evidence of your citizenship. Have you ever had a passport before?

Orlando: No, I haven’t.

Clerk: In that case, you’ll need to submit a copy of your birth certificate, or if you were born outside of the country, a copy of your Naturalization Certificate or a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

Orlando: I don’t have those documents with me.

Clerk: Come back when you do.

Orlando: Okay, I’m back. I have a copy of my birth certificate.

Clerk: All right. Let me see some identification.

Orlando: Identification?

Clerk: Yes, I need to see a valid driver’s license, a government ID, or a military ID.

Orlando: I’ll be right back.

Clerk: Yes?

Orlando: Here’s my military ID.

Clerk: Where are you passport photos?

Orlando: Passport photos?

Clerk: Yes, you need two identical passport photos.

Orlando: I’ll be right back.

### 0558 Being a Strict Parent

Allison: I’m almost ready for my granddaughter’s visit. She’ll be here tomorrow and I want everything to be perfect.

Ola: What do you have planned?

Allison: I’m going to spoil her rotten. My daughter is very strict and doesn’t allow her to do anything that a normal 10-year-old wants to do.

Ola: Like what?

Allison: Well, her time is very structured and regimented. She’s never allowed any time for just frivolous fun.

Ola: And you’re taking off the shackles.

Allison: That’s right. She can play as much as she wants to for the next week. I don’t want her to miss out on any experiences just because her mother is overprotective. There will be no curfews and no time schedules.

Ola: Are you sure that’s a good idea? I’m sure your daughter has instructions about how your granddaughter should behave and the punishments she should get if she misbehaves.

Allison: You’re right about that. I’m expecting a long list of rules for my granddaughter while she’s here, but she shouldn’t expect me to toe the line. I’m the grandmother after all, so I have special privileges. Nobody tells me what to do with my own granddaughter.

Ola: How did a free spirit like you end up with a daughter who is so uptight?

Allison: Beats me.

Ola: She’s not going to thank you for spoiling her daughter, you know.

Allison: I know, but I’m her mother and there’s still a thing or two I can teach her about raising a daughter!

### 0559 Ending a Restaurant Meal

Server: Can I clear these plates and get them out of your way?

Alvin: Sure, we’re all done. Can I get the rest of that in a doggie bag?

Server: No problem. I’ll wrap it up for you. Is there anything else I can get you? Did you leave room for dessert? How about some coffee or tea?

Alvin: No, I’m stuffed. Just the check for me, thanks.

Server: Sure, coming right up.

…

Server: Here’s your check. I’ll take that when you’re ready.

Alvin: Do you accept personal checks?

Server: No, I’m afraid we don’t.

Alvin: How about credit cards?

Server: Yes, we do accept credit cards.

Alvin: Here’s my Discover card.

Server: Oh, we don’t accept that one.

Alvin: Okay, here’s my American Express.

Server: Sorry, but we don’t take that one either. We only accept Visa or MasterCard.

Alvin: I don’t have a Visa or MasterCard.

Server: We also accept cash, of course.

Alvin: I don’t have any cash on me. Is there an ATM nearby?

Server: There’s one about three blocks away, but you’ll need to leave something with us so we know you’re not running out on the check.

Alvin: How about my doggie bag?

Server: How about your cell phone or your driver’s license?

Alvin: Okay, here’s my cell phone. I’ll be back ASAP.

Server: No rush. I’ll be right here making a few calls to Bora Bora.

### 0560 Learning Work Rules and Routines

I was happy to finally get a job, but I wasn’t ready for a first day of work like this one.

…

Boss: This is your first day and my job is to give you the rundown on how we do things around here. This is a well-oiled machine. Everybody has to pull his or her weight, or things don’t run smoothly. Got that?

Olivia: Yes, I do. I’m here to learn and to get up to speed as quickly as possible.

Boss: Good. I expect you to know the drill and be able to fall in line by the end of the week.

Olivia: I will do my very best.

Boss: We don’t like surprises around here, so we’ve built our workday around a lot of routines that every employee follows. We expect people to arrive at 8:30 on the nose. That’s our start time and there is no leeway whatsoever. If you’re habitually late, you’re out. Got that?

Olivia: Got it.

Boss: We’re no run-of-the-mill company. We have a tried and true system here and we expect all of our employees to follow lockstep. Got that?

Olivia: Yes, sir.

…

I needed a job, but when I was offered this one, I didn’t know what I was letting myself in for. I didn’t have a new boss. I had a drill sergeant!

### 0561 Being Forgetful

Charlize: You won’t forget that we’re going over to the Wong’s for dinner tomorrow night, will you?

Pete: It’s etched in my brain. I won’t forget.

Charlize: It slipped your mind last week that we were meeting Donna at the movies, remember?

Pete: I was preoccupied last week, but I won’t forget about tomorrow night.

Charlize: I’m reminding you because the week before that, you forgot to cash that check at the bank. Remember that?

Pete: I didn’t forget. I was just a little wrapped up in work that week. I’m not usually absentminded, you know.

Charlize: Right. Do you want me to send you an email tomorrow morning to jog your memory?

Pete: That won’t be necessary. I have the day, time, and even their address committed to memory. Do you want to test me?

Charlize: No, I don’t, but I just want to make sure we don’t have a repeat of what happened last month. You were supposed to meet me at the Donnelly’s at 8:00 and you never showed up. Remember that?

Pete: No, I don’t. I have amnesia. I won’t remember any other incident you want to throw in my face. I thought last week you said you would stop giving me a hard time about my bad memory. Remember that?

Charlize: Uh, no, I don’t.

Pete: I guess I’m not the only one who’s scatterbrained!

### 0562 Buying Fake Products

Lindsay: Look at this designer bag I bought. It was such a steal!

Rafael: Let me see that. You do know that this is an imitation, not the real thing, right?

Lindsay: What do you mean? Of course it’s real.

Rafael: Where did you buy it?

Lindsay: Well, there was a guy on the street selling all of these genuine designer bags. He said he got them straight from the factory, and that’s why he could sell them at such a markdown.

Rafael: The reason he could sell it dirt cheap is because this is a knockoff. I know you’re a sucker for a bargain, but I can’t believe you fell for his line.

Lindsay: How do you know this is a knockoff? Are you an expert on women’s handbags? I still think this is real, and I’m sure I didn’t get ripped off.

Rafael: Whatever you say. As they say, there’s a sucker born every minute!

### 0563 Reducing Household Expenses

Roland: If we want to save enough money to buy a house, we need to get serious about our finances and do some financial planning. I think the first step is to create a household budget.

Ginger: Okay by me. You know that I’m all about the bottom line.

Roland: Yeah, right. I think we have a pretty good idea of our spending patterns, so it shouldn’t be too hard to come up with a budget that we can both live with.

Ginger: Right.

Roland: Okay, one thing we need to keep in mind is that we tend to underestimate our monthly expenses. If you look at our discretionary spending on this spreadsheet I created, you’ll be surprised at how much money we spend on nonessentials.

Ginger: Okay, I can cut back on nonessentials.

Roland: You can?

Ginger: Sure, instead of getting my nails done every week, I’ll get them done only three times a month.

Roland: Well, that’s a start…

Ginger: And instead of buying a new 60-inch TV, we can get a 52-inch one instead. That should save us a lot of money.

Roland: I think you need to do the math. If we don’t cut back much more drastically, we’ll be ready for retirement by the time we can afford a house!

### 0564 Working in a Laboratory

I was working in the lab, as usual, when my colleague brought his three-year-old son into work.

…

Tony: Hi, Gale. This is my son, Philippe. There was a problem with his daycare today, so he’ll be spending the day here with me. I’ll teach him all about doing research.

Gale: I’m not sure this is a good place for a toddler. Should he be playing with the microscope like that?

Tony: Oh, he’ll be fine. I’ll just keep the beakers and test tubes out of his reach and he’ll be all right.

Gale: Whoa, he almost tipped over that tray of Petri dishes. I’m using those for the experiment I’m running, and there are some pretty dangerous chemicals in them.

Tony: Good thing you saw him before he could do any real damage. I think he just wants to help, right? You just want to collect some data for Gale, right?

Gale: Don’t look now but he’s emptying those solutions into the pockets of your lab coat.

Tony: Oh, you silly goose! You’re just trying to make work more fun and interesting for us, aren’t you?

### 0565 Dating a Friend’s Ex

Fareed: Where are you going?

Amber: I’m going to meet Peter.

Fareed: When are you going to tell Lily?

Amber: Tell her what?

Fareed: You know what – that you’re dating her ex. She’s not going to take it well.

Amber: I don’t know why she would object. They broke up over a year ago and they’ve both moved on.

Fareed: Peter has moved on, but Lily still has a thing for him. You know that as well as I do.

Amber: She never said that he was off-limits. It’s not like we’re sneaking around behind her back.

Fareed: Aren’t you? She’s one of your best friends and you haven’t clued her in on the two of you yet. If you don’t tell her soon, when she finds out, all hell is going to break loose.

Amber: That’s not fair. If there were a statute of limitations on ex-boyfriends, then we’re well past that. He’s fair game.

Fareed: That’s not how she’s going to see it. If you ask me, you have two options: break it off with Peter or tell Lily now, before she finds out from someone else. Tell her the truth and let the chips fall where they may.

Amber: That’s easy for you to say. You’re not facing Lily’s wrath. I think I’ll keep this under wraps for now, thank you very much.

Fareed: Fine, but it’s your funeral.

### 0566 Having a Wild Party

Paula: Okay, let’s get this party started!

Mitch: I really don’t think having a party is such a good idea. We’re supposed to be house-sitting, and I’m sure the Abrams wouldn’t want their house used for a big blowout.

Paula: Ignorance is bliss. They’ll never know. Stop being such a goody two-shoes and help me set up.

Mitch: What if something gets broken or damaged? Things usually get out of hand when people start pounding back a few.

Paula: What do you think I’m doing? I’m moving the breakables to the other room. Nothing will happen.

Mitch: How can you say that? At Kyle’s party last month, two guys got into it and ended up trashing his parents’ house!

Paula: That’s because they didn’t have Babbit.

Mitch: What’s a Babbit?

Paula: Babbit is the name of an old high school friend of mine and he’s tough as nails. He’ll be here to bust heads and to keep everybody in line. Trust me. Nothing bad will happen with Babbit playing bouncer. Where are you going?

Mitch: I’m getting out while I can. This is a disaster waiting to happen.

Paula: You’re not staying for the party? You’re leaving?

Mitch: Wouldn’t you, if you were on the Titanic?

### 0567 Visiting a Patient in the Hospital

George: You’re just in time. There’s only another 20 minutes until the end of visiting hours.

Inez: I got here as soon as I could. How is Uncle Peter?

George: They moved him from the emergency ward to the intensive care unit. He’s on life support.

Inez: How could this have happened? How could somebody in the prime of his life collapse suddenly like that?

George: They’ve been running tests all day, and the doctor is supposed to come by after her rounds to talk to us. Hopefully, we’ll get some answers then, and she’ll give us an update on Uncle Peter’s condition. Come on, I’ll take you to the ICU.

Inez: Okay, but I really dread seeing him on a respirator and hooked up to monitors.

George: This is it, room 323.

Inez: Oh, look at him. What are all of these IV drips for? He looks so lifeless in that hospital bed. Is he under sedation?

George: Yeah, I think so. We’ll know more when the doctor gets here. Oh, here she is.

Inez: Let’s hope she has some answers for us.

### 0568 Describing Brisk and Slow Business

Clint: Anya! Long time no see. Let me buy you a drink. I’m celebrating.

Anya: Oh, yeah? What’s the good news?

Clint: My company has had a banner month. Since we launched our new line of software, we’re having trouble keeping up with demand. Every product is flying off the shelves.

Anya: Wow, that’s great news. Everybody I talk to is singing a different tune. Foot traffic is down and business is slow – really slow.

Clint: That’s too bad. I thought that Yao’s company was doing brisk business. Six months ago, he was selling a line of cell phones that was all the rage, and customers were beating down his door to get one.

Anya: That was six months ago. It’s a different story now. Those cell phones are now considered passé, and he has inventory he can’t unload. You know how fickle the market is.

Clint: I’m sorry to hear that. How about you? How’s the travel business?

Anya: Why do you think I’m sitting here crying in my beer? Pull up a chair and I’ll tell you my sob story.

### 0569 Traveling for Singles

Ray: I have a great idea for your next vacation. You should go on a singles cruise.

Samantha: I’m not going on a singles cruise. Everybody will be on the make.

Ray: That’s the point, isn’t it? You can take your pick of single guys. What could be better?

Samantha: I’m not interested in having a fling!

Ray: You’ll never meet anybody if you don’t get out there and mingle. Look, here’s a 10-day tour through Asia and the tour company will even match you with someone before the trip. You can use the time on the tour to get better acquainted.

Samantha: That sounds awful. What if I don’t like the person I’m matched with? I’m stuck with him for 10 days, and we’ll both be miserable.

Ray: Okay, here’s something you’ll like – a single’s adventure vacation. You can enjoy the great outdoors, while you get to know the single guys on the tour. The worst case scenario is that you don’t meet a guy you like. You’ll still have a great vacation. What do you have to lose?

Samantha: My peace of mind! Okay, you’re my brother, and you’re trying to look out for me, but leave me alone and stop trying to marry me off. I’m happy being single. Can’t you get that through your thick skull?

Ray: Sure, you’re happy. That’s why you’re always such a ray of sunshine!

### 0570 Guessing a Number

Angela: Hey, look at this. This restaurant is holding a contest. If you can guess the number of marbles in this bowl, you’ll get a free meal every day for one year!

Dwight: I’ll take a stab at it.

Angela: So will I. Let’s see, I think there must be close to 1,000 or 1,200 marbles in there. What are you doing?

Dwight: I’m doing some calculations in my head. The bowl is about 75 percent full, and it’s 15 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches (15”x12”x6”). The marbles are about ¾ of an inch in diameter…

Angela: Are you actually trying to figure out the capacity by crunching the numbers? This is a game. You’re supposed to guess.

Dwight: I know it’s a game, but I want to increase my chances by making an educated guess. Hold on, I just need to do one more calculation and I’ll have the magic number.

Angela: That’s cheating.

Dwight: No way! I’m just using what God gave me to beat you out of a year’s worth of meals.

Angela: Bring it on. I’ll pit my random guess against your educated guess any day!

### 0571 Assigning Blame in a Car Accident

Tarik: Are you okay?

Stacey: Yeah, I think so. I’m just a little shaken up, but look at my car!

Tarik: Mine is in pretty bad shape, too. Good thing, though, it wasn’t totaled.

Stacey: Okay, let’s exchange insurance information, so we can both get out of here.

Tarik: Right. I’ll put in a claim today and your insurance should pay to repair both of our cars.

Stacey: What? This accident wasn’t my fault. You crashed into me! You rear ended me!

Tarik: That’s only because you swerved in front of me and slammed on your brakes!

Stacey: I did no such thing. I changed lanes and you began tailgating me. That’s why you rear ended me. I’m not to blame here.

Tarik: That’s your account of what happened, and it doesn’t jibe with mine. I say we each call our respective insurance companies and let them battle it out.

Stacey: Fine. There’s no point in arguing with someone who won’t own up to his mistakes.

Tarik: Those are my thoughts exactly.

### 0572 Blowing the Whistle at Work

Becky: What are we going to do?

Saeed: I don’t know. I need time to think about the ramifications of blowing the whistle.

Becky: There are no two ways about it. If we step up and do the right thing, we are putting our jobs on the line.

Saeed: But we can’t keep quiet about this. If it gets out, and we knew about it all along, we’ll get into even more trouble. And plus, think of how many people would be hurt if we kept our mouths shut. Could we live with that?

Becky: Maybe there is a way for us to protect our interests and still do the right thing. Maybe we could be anonymous whistleblowers.

Saeed: Don’t count on being able to remain anonymous. When this thing blows up, we’ll be in knee-deep. There’s only one thing to do.

Becky: What?

Saeed: I have to put my money where my mouth is and go public with what we know. I’ll just have to let the chips fall where they may.

Becky: Don’t be too hasty. Let’s sleep on it and talk about it tomorrow.

Saeed: You can do that if you want to, but I’ve made up my mind. The question is: Are you with me?

### 0573 Discussing Social Class

Hector: Can you believe James? All evening, he tried to tell me how this country would be better if we had no social classes. He’s out of his mind.

Sophia: He was just trying to get a rise out of you. We all know that the two of you don’t see eye to eye.

Hector: He thinks that just because he comes from a working-class background, he can criticize anyone who is middle class or upper class. I just can’t stand his holier-than-thou attitude.

Sophia: He knows you, and he knows which buttons to push to get you worked up. I don’t think he was serious when he said he thought class warfare was a good idea.

Hector: Well, he was downright insulting. He talks as though we have no sense of social responsibility. We do our share for the poor. What more does he want from me?

Sophia: I think he has a chip on his shoulder, because his parents are blue collar and he now lives in a white-collar world. He feels he has to stand up for the marginalized people in our society.

Hector: Okay, but does that mean I have to allow him to insult me under my own roof?

Sophia: Of course not. Next week, we’re having dinner at their house.

### 0574 Shopping for Produce

On my way home from work, I stopped at the supermarket. My doctor has been telling me to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, so I finally decided to follow her advice. I resolved to eat better, so I could feel better. I made a beeline for the produce department.

First, I looked at some bananas. Since they ripen off the vine, I picked out some that were already ripe and others that were still green. Next, I looked for some tomatoes. They looked picked over, but then I saw some organic tomatoes and decided to give those a try. Then, I went to look for the spinach. I found it, but it didn’t look fresh at all. The leaves were brown and wilted. I decided to pass on the spinach and checked out the mushrooms. The mushrooms didn’t look any better. In fact, some were beginning to rot. I picked up some lettuce instead and headed for the checkout stand.

I was feeling pretty good about my new decision to eat better. But then, I passed the cookie aisle. My resolve weakened. I spotted my favorite type of cookies. Before I knew what I was doing, I’d put a bag of those cookies in my cart.

I know I should be able to resist impulse buys, especially of things I’m likely to eat all in one sitting, but don’t forget, I’m eating more fruits and vegetables. With my new healthy diet, aren’t I allowed to fall off the wagon now and then?

### 0575 Being an Early or Late Riser

Spiro: Hey, watch out!

Nancy: Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t see you there. I thought I would be the only person up at the crack of dawn. What are you doing sitting on the stoop at this ungodly hour?

Spiro: I’m trying to turn over a new leaf.

Nancy: What do you mean?

Spiro: I’m in the habit of staying up until all hours of the night. I hardly ever get enough sleep and walk around all day sleep-deprived. I’m trying to see if I can make the switch from being a night owl to an early riser. I’m hoping the new hours will make me a changed man.

Nancy: That sounds very commendable, but that still doesn’t answer my question. What are you doing sitting out here?

Spiro: I’m waiting for the coffee shop to open.

Nancy: Can you eat breakfast this early in the morning?

Spiro: No, but I can drink coffee, lots and lots of coffee.

Nancy: You’ll definitely be the first one in line.

Spiro: I guess what they say is true: the early bird gets the worm.

Nancy: I don’t know about worms, but the early bird will definitely get the first dose of caffeine!

### 0576 Using Unfair Influence

Josey: Hello, I’m Josey Kim.

Curt: Hi, I’m Curt West. Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

Josey: You mentioned on the phone that you can help us get that government contract we’re bidding on, is that right?

Curt: Absolutely. I’m sure I can be of service to your company and secure that contract without too much difficulty.

Josey: I appreciate your confidence, but can you tell me more about how you plan to do that?

Curt: I think the less said the better. Let’s just say that I have friends in high places.

Josey: I’m not sure I understand you.

Curt: Come on, you know how business is done on Capitol Hill. If you line the right pockets, it’s not difficult to pull some strings to get what you want.

Josey: Are you suggesting that our company use bribery to get preferential treatment on our bid?

Curt: I’m simply saying that backroom deals are business as usual in the government.

Josey: If you’re suggesting that we hire you to do influence peddling, I can tell you now that we’re not interested. Corruption may be rampant in government, but we’re not willing to do anything unethical to get a contract.

Curt: Suit yourself, but without somebody like me doing your dirty work, there’s no way you’re going to win that contract.

Josey: That may be, Mr. West, but that’s a chance we’re willing to take.

### 0577 Magic and Illusions

Patricia: This is the best magic show I’ve ever seen. Have you ever seen so many amazing magic tricks in your life? They’re blowing my mind!

Sergio: They’re all just illusions. It’s nothing but smoke and mirrors.

Patricia: I don’t know how you can say that. We’ve seen some really impressive sleight of hand tricks and that escape artist seemed to do the impossible.

Sergio: Couldn’t you see that it was just misdirection? While you weren’t looking, the magician left through the trap door.

Patricia: Maybe that’s how that trick was done, but how do you explain the mind reader? How did he know what I was thinking if he couldn’t really read my mind?

Sergio: I’m sure any supernatural powers these magicians and entertainers claim to have have been debunked by somebody. Maybe he used the power of suggestion. Who knows?

Patricia: And maybe you’re just jaded.

Sergio: And maybe you’re the most gullible person who ever lived!

### 0578 Eating a Home-Cooked Meal

Louise: What’s the matter with you?

Gil: I just got off the phone with my mom and she says they’re planning a welcome-home party for me next week – at a restaurant!

Louise: What’s wrong with that?

Gil: After living abroad for a year, I was really looking forward to a home-cooked meal.

Louise: Why didn’t you just tell your mother that?

Gil: I didn’t have the heart to do that. She was so excited about the party, and who am I to tell her she has to slave over a hot stove to cook me a lavish dinner?

Louise: I’m sure she wouldn’t mind. It’d be a labor of love.

Gil: You don’t know my mother. She doesn’t cut corners and makes everything from scratch. She uses these recipes that were passed down to her from her mother. She can make the most intricate dishes, but what I’m craving are the comfort foods she always made for us when we were kids. It makes my mouth water just thinking about her cooking.

Louise: After a year of living on instant noodles and take-out food, I’m not surprised you want something home-cooked. I tell you what. After the party, come over to my house and I’ll have a home-cooked meal ready for you.

Gil: You, cook for me? Thanks, but no thanks!

### 0579 Telling People Where You’re From

Cora: Hi, I’m Cora.

Antonio: I’m Antonio. Nice to meet you.

Cora: Same here. Are you from around here?

Antonio: No, I’m originally from Arkansas. How about you?

Cora: I’m a native Californian, but I grew up in the Middle East. My parents were in the military, so we moved quite a bit, but mainly around the Middle East.

Antonio: That’s really interesting. I spent some time in Jordan myself a few years ago doing research for my company. But I’ve lived in Los Angeles for over 10 years and consider it my adopted hometown.

Cora: Isn’t that funny? Even though I was born here, I only moved back here two months ago. I’m sure you know the city much better than I do.

Antonio: I’d be happy to show you around, to help you get reacquainted with L.A.

Cora: I was only eight years old when my family moved away, so I have a lot of catching up to do.

Antonio: Let’s start next weekend. I’ll show you some of the places where the locals like to hang out.

Cora: That sounds great. Is this how all Angelinos treat newcomers?

Antonio: Absolutely! I’m the city’s one-man welcome wagon.

### 0580 Retiring From a Job

Meredith: Are you going to Stanley’s retirement party?

Oscar: Sure, I want a glimpse of the future. I can’t wait to retire.

Meredith: It’ll be a long time before you get the golden handshake. Me? I may be ready for early retirement.

Oscar: Are you seriously thinking about taking the early retirement package the company is offering?

Meredith: I’m thinking about it. My health isn’t getting any better, and I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in this office.

Oscar: But can you afford it?

Meredith: The early retirement package is pretty generous, and I’ve saved up a nice little nest egg over the years.

Oscar: Then what are you waiting for? If I were in your shoes, I wouldn’t hem and haw about it. I’d make the decision to retire now – today!

Meredith: Why are you getting all worked up? Are you after my job?

Oscar: No way! I just can’t stand to see someone who can retire stay at this job. I’d trade places with you in a minute.

Meredith: I doubt that – not if it meant being a card-carrying member of AARP. You’re too young to be thinking about retirement.

Oscar: I didn’t say I was ready for retirement. I’m just thinking about it – all the time!

### 0581 Reading a World Map

Greg: What are you doing with that map and that globe?

Julianna: I’m trying to keep track of Carmen as she travels from country to country. I just got another postcard from her today.

Greg: I’m not sure I like the idea of my daughter traveling around the world with a group of people for three months. It’s not safe.

Julianna: She can take care of herself. You know she’s the adventurous type. Give her a compass and she can find her way around anywhere. Help me find Nauru on this map. I don’t even know what continent it’s on. I was never any good at geography.

Greg: All right. You look above the equator and I’ll look below it, but couldn’t you just look it up on the Internet? It would be easy to find the latitude and longitude of this place.

Julianna: This is more fun. I sort of feel like I’m on an adventure myself.

Greg: I can’t make heads or tails of this map. It’s not to scale and this legend is all wrong!

Julianna: It doesn’t matter. We just need to find the place name, and then I can put a pin in this map showing where’s she’s been.

Greg: I have a better idea. I’ll look it up on the Internet and get you all of the vital statistics you’d want, like its location, okay?

Julianna: Forget it. Sometimes it’s more fun doing things the hard way.

### 0582 A Parent-Teacher Conference

Ms. Vasquez: Hello, Mr. Polo. I’m Ms. Vasquez. Please have a seat.

Mr. Polo: Thank you.

Ms. Vasquez: In this parent-teacher conference, I want to go beyond Marco’s report cards and his standardized test scores to talk about his general performance in the classroom.

Mr. Polo: That’s great. I want to know how he’s doing.

Ms. Vasquez: Marco is a good student. He’s attentive in class, a hard worker, and hands in his homework on time. Here’s his portfolio, if you want to take a look at his classroom work.

Mr. Polo: This is great. Are there any areas he needs to work on?

Ms. Vasquez: Marco is a good student, but he does sometimes misbehave. He often has disagreements with other students and loses his temper. I think he needs to work on his social skills.

Mr. Polo: Well, I don’t think that’s the most important thing, do you? His academics are the most important and he seems to be doing well in his subjects.

Ms. Vasquez: It’s true that academics are important, but learning to work cooperatively with other people is important, too, if he wants to get ahead in life, don’t you think?

Mr. Polo: I’ll have a talk with him. I’m sure you’ll see an improvement.

Ms. Vasquez: I appreciate you taking this seriously. Again, Marco is a good student and it’s a pleasure to have him in my class.

Mr. Polo: I’m glad to hear that. Good-bye.

Ms. Vasquez: Have a good afternoon.

### 0583 Going to a Spa

Jan: This is the life! Spending the day at a spa is my idea of paradise.

Tim: Yeah, it’s great.

Jan: Aren’t you enjoying yourself?

Tim: The massage was okay, but why do I have to get a facial and a body wrap? I’m a guy!

Jan: Men need rejuvenating, too. These are all holistic treatments and you’ll feel like a new man when you’re done. Just enjoy the pampering.

Tim: I feel like an idiot. How am I supposed to relax?

Jan: Why don’t you get a body scrub or a scalp massage instead? Maybe that’ll calm your nerves.

Tim: I don’t need a body scrub or another massage. I just want to get out of here. When will we be done?

Jan: After this, all we have left are manicures and pedicures.

Tim: What?! I’m not getting a manicure or a pedicure.

Jan: You did promise to go with me to the spa if I agreed to have your four college friends stay in our house for two weeks, remember?

Tim: Yes, I remember. All right, let’s get this over with.

Jan: Just be glad I didn’t sign you up for waxing!

### 0584 Calling in Sick to Work

I was fed up with work and wanted the day off. I decided to call in sick. I wasn’t prepared, though, to be peppered with questions.

Peter: Hello, this is Peter. Is this Magda?

Magda: Yes. This is Magda.

Peter: Hi, Magda. I won’t be coming in today. I’m not feeling well. I think I’ve come down with something.

Magda: Hmm, what seems to be the problem?

Peter: The problem? Oh…I’ve been up all night throwing up and I feel terrible.

Magda: Didn’t you have something like this two weeks ago when you called in sick?

Peter: Two weeks ago? No, I had food poisoning two weeks ago.

Magda: And what about a month ago when you called in sick?

Peter: That was a 24-hour bug.

Magda: Didn’t you just take a day off from work because of a death in the family?

Peter: Yes, I had to go to the funeral.

Magda: I see. That’s one day off from work a week, four weeks in a row. [long silence]

Peter: Uh, I’ll be in within the hour.

Magda: I’m glad you’ve had a miraculous recovery.

### 0585 Being Clear or Confusing

Laurent: So I’m confused. Who’s David again?

Bethany: David is my roommate’s friend’s brother. Haven’t you been listening?

Laurent: I have, but how am I supposed to keep all of these people straight? Your stories are always so convoluted, with too many twists and turns. Why don’t you try telling a straightforward story for once?

Bethany: My stories are only confusing for people who don’t pay attention or who can’t deal with complexity.

Laurent: Complexity? Is that what you call going off on tangents and including completely irrelevant information? Half the time the end of the story contradicts the beginning!

Bethany: You just don’t appreciate intricate plots. My stories are crystal clear to anyone who pays attention. Good stories have lots of detail. Just ask Shakespeare.

Laurent: Talk about delusions of grandeur! When you start comparing yourself to Shakespeare, it’s time for you to seek professional help!

### 0586 Getting a Girlfriend/Boyfriend Back

Grace: What are you doing?

Yuji: I’m working on a plan to get April back.

Grace: I think that’s a lost cause. You guys broke up three months ago. There’s no way she’ll take you back.

Yuji: Watch me prove you wrong. When I tell April about all of the ways I’m going to change and to make her happy, she’ll let bygones be bygones.

Grace: You’re dreaming. She won’t be duped by a bunch of empty promises.

Yuji: They’re not empty promises. I really am going to change, within reason.

Grace: Do you really think April is going to forget all of the things you’ve done to her in the past?

Yuji: I’m not going to rake up the past. I’m going to show her the new me, and she’ll know I’m sincere. After all, she used to be crazy about me. I’m sure it’s just a matter of me making the effort.

Grace: Pride comes before a fall, you know. I think you’d have a better chance if you got down on your knees and begged her for mercy!

### 0587 Feeling Disillusioned

Daniela: I did it. I finally met Mandy Timpkin.

Tony: Mandy Timpkin, your idol?

Daniela: Yeah, I stood in line for two days at her book signing and finally met her. It was a big disappointment.

Tony: Really? I thought she could do no wrong, as far as you’re concerned.

Daniela: Well, that was before I met her. I have always wanted to be just like her. She had everything going for her: a great life and a great career. I emulated her in so many ways. I thought she must be a paragon of virtue and a great person to be around. I walked into that bookstore with all of these preconceived notions.

Tony: What happened to shatter your image of her?

Daniela: While I waited in line, I saw what kind of person she really was. She was rude to everybody and made ridiculous demands of her assistants. It wasn’t how I pictured her at all. She was a real diva.

Tony: So meeting her really burst your bubble.

Daniela: Yeah, it really did. I guess it was my own fault for putting her on a pedestal.

Tony: Well, you’re not the only one. Celebrities wouldn’t be celebrities if we didn’t idolize them.

Daniela: True enough, and I’ve learned my lesson. Nobody’s perfect, least of all celebrities!

### 0588 Hiring Business Consultants

Erica: So your suggestion is to hire outside consultants to handle the extra work associated with the expansion.

Stefan: I think there are a lot of benefits: we get someone with the right expertise quickly, we can use him or her as needed, and we can save on employment taxes and benefits. What’s not to like?

Erica: I’m just not sure that’s the right move right now.

Stefan: To me, it’s a no-brainer. We call the shots. If we don’t like the consultant’s work, then we can terminate our relationship at any time.

Erica: Yes, but that also means that the consultant won’t feel any company loyalty and could quit working with us whenever he or she wanted to, leaving us in a lurch.

Stefan: That’s true, but that’s also true of any employee. Company loyalty is a thing of the past. I really think we should move ahead.

Erica: Well, I think we should take it one step at a time. Start with contracting consultants for smaller projects and see how they do before we have them work on this big one.

Stefan: Okay, I can live with that, as long as we don’t drag our feet in getting people started on the big project.

Erica: Don’t worry. If I drag my feet, I know you’ll tow me along.

### 0589 Having Skin Problems

Mother: Doctor, this is my son Danny. I brought him in so you could look at his rash.

Doctor: Okay, Danny. Have a seat on the exam table. How long have you had the rash?

Mother: My son has had that rash for about two weeks. It started out as a blister, and then it got really itchy and turned red. Could it be an infection?

Doctor: I’ll need to take a closer look at it first before I can tell you that.

Mother: I hope it’s not anything serious. I hope it’s not skin cancer!

Doctor: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Okay, let’s take a look…

Mother: While you’re at it, could you look at this bump on Danny’s neck? I think it’s a mole.

Doctor: That looks like a birthmark, but I’ll take a look.

Mother: And could you look at this wart? If you remove it, will it leave a scar?

Doctor: I’m not sure it is a wart. Let me examine it first, and I’ll tell you what treatment I recommend.

Mother: Oh, and Doctor, could you look at Danny’s pimples? He just started getting them. I had really bad acne when I was his age.

Doctor: Is there anything else?

Mother: Well, since you asked…

### 0590 Paying Airline Fees

Justine: So that’s the plan. We drive to San Francisco, then to Portland, then to Seattle, and then to Vancouver.

Howie: What? Why are we driving to Vancouver instead of flying?

Justine: Haven’t you noticed all of the fees the airlines are tacking on these days? First, there were the fuel surcharges and now, there is a whole slew of added fees.

Howie: Like what?

Justine: Well, there’s a checked baggage fee, for one. On some airlines, you have to pay to check just one bag, and each additional bag is another fee. If you have oversize or overweight bags, that’s another fee.

Howie: Okay, I don’t like fees either, but I don’t think that justifies driving all the way to Vancouver.

Justine: Well, let me tell you about some of the other fees. Do you want a snack or a meal on the flight? You’re going to have to shell out for those now. Do you want to fly standby? Yes, it used to be free, but not anymore. Do you want to make your reservation by phone instead of on the Internet? That’s another fee. Do you want a pillow or a blanket for your long flight? Okay, but that’s another fee!

Howie: Okay, don’t get worked up. I see what you mean. They really know how to nickel and dime you. Once we add all of those fees to the base fare, I guess flying isn’t such a good deal. But do you really want us to drive three days to get to Vancouver?

Justine: What’s the problem with driving?

Howie: Oh, I don’t know, maybe it’s the fact that I only have a week for vacation? As soon as we get to Vancouver, we’ll have to turn back!

### 0591 Handling a Traffic Stop

I was having a great day until I saw the police car behind me with its loud siren and lights flashing. I pulled off the road and waited for the officer to approach my car.

Officer: May I see your driver’s license, proof of insurance, and car registration, please?

Lindsay: Let me get them out of my glove compartment. Here they are. What did I do wrong, officer?

Officer: Didn’t you see that stop sign back there?

Lindsay: Stop sign? What stop sign? I didn’t see any stop sign.

Officer: Sit tight and I’ll be right back.

…

I guess he was running my driver’s license and license plate numbers to make sure there are no outstanding warrants for me or for my car. He came back after a few minutes.

…

Officer: You ran a stop sign back there and I’m going to have to give you a citation.

Lindsay: Is that really necessary, officer? I’m really sorry I ran the stop sign and I’ll be more careful next time.

Officer: I suppose I could let you off with a warning, just this once.

Lindsay: Oh, thank you so much!

Officer: Drive more carefully in the future.

Lindsay: I will. I definitely will.

…

Phew! That was close. Good thing I tossed the incriminating evidence out the window before I pulled off the road!

### 0592 Dealing with Website Hackers

Valerie: You’ll never guess what happened over the weekend.

Bill: What?

Valerie: Our website was attacked by hackers, and nobody could access it.

Bill: You’re kidding! What did they do?

Valerie: They got access to our server and embedded some malicious code that caused the site to be redirected to their own website.

Bill: But I thought our site had really good security. Didn’t we hire a programmer last year to encrypt the database and patch any vulnerabilities?

Valerie: That’s what we should have done. So now, we’re paying the price.

Bill: The site seems to be back up, though.

Valerie: Yeah, we brought in a specialist on Friday and she’s been working on it 24/7. Let’s hope she puts in the security measures we should have had all along, and this will never happen again.

Bill: Right, at least until some creative hacker comes up with a new way to wreak havoc.

### 0593 Staying Home from School

Carin: We’re going to be late for school. Hurry up!

Hwan: I’m not going to school today. I’m sick.

Carin: You’re not sick. You’re playing hooky. You’re not going to put one over on Mom. She’ll know you’re faking. Get up! Let’s go!

Hwan: No, she won’t, and why are you giving me such a hard time? It’s not like you’ve never played hooky before.

Carin: I may cut class now and then, but I have a foolproof way of doing it so I don’t get caught.

Hwan: You mean you forge notes from Mom to let you get out of class for doctor’s appointments and things like that. I know all about that.

Carin: Who told you?

Hwan: I keep my eyes and ears open. I pick things up.

Carin: If you know so much, then you should know that pretending to be sick never works. Mom will make you go to school anyway. There are better ways to get an excused absence.

Hwan: How? I have a test in biology today and I have to get out of it. Help me!

Carin: I suppose I could, out of the goodness of my heart.

Hwan: Come on. If you do, I’ll owe you one, a big one.

Carin: All right. You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours. Here’s what you have to do…

### 0594 Competition and Prizes

Olga: Are you going to take me on, or are you chicken?

Apollo: Me chicken? No way! Bring it on!

Olga: Okay, but get ready to get trounced. I’m going to teach you a thing or two about how this game should be played. Ready for some humiliation?

Apollo: Stop trash-talking and get over here. What are we playing for? How about 20 or 30 dollars?

Olga: Those stakes are too high. Let’s say that the champion will get bragging rights.

Apollo: Bragging rights?! If I can’t have a cash prize, I was hoping for at least a trophy or a medal.

Olga: Yeah, right. You want a medal for winning at thumb wrestling?!

Apollo: As far as I’m concerned, thumb wrestling should be an Olympic sport!

### 0595 Suffering from Allergies

Victor: Oh, doctor, you’ve got to help me!

Doctor: Try to relax. What seems to be the problem?

Victor: I’m sneezing all the time, and my eyes are itchy and watery.

Doctor: Tilt your head back so I can take a look at your nasal passages. You’re very congested.

Victor: My sinuses are killing me! I have headaches all the time and nothing I do seems to help.

Doctor: What is this on your skin?

Victor: I don’t know. I’ve had red spots all over my body.

Doctor: They look like hives to me. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath?

Victor: Well, my chest feels constricted and it’s hard to breathe.

Doctor: I think you may be experiencing a severe allergy attack. I’m going to refer you to an allergist. What were you doing right before you started experiencing these symptoms?

Victor: I started my first job.

Doctor: That could be your problem.

Victor: I knew it! I’m allergic to work!

### 0596 Applying for Unemployment Benefits

Agency Employee: Hello, state unemployment agency.

George: Hello, I’d like to apply for unemployment benefits.

Agency Employee: Okay, give me your address and I’ll send you an application.

George: How much can I get?

Agency Employee: That depends. Your benefits are calculated based on your quarterly earnings. You were laid off from your job?

George: Yes, I was. I qualify, don’t I?

Agency Employee: People who work part-time jobs or are self-employed aren’t eligible. If you worked in a full-time position, you should qualify. Fill out the application and we’ll let you know.

George: What else does the application ask for?

Agency Employee: You have to affirm that you’re able to work and that you’re actively seeking employment.

George: I’m definitely doing that. I’ve been meaning to ask you, are you hiring?

### 0597 Describing Touch and Textures

Tommy: It’s just our luck that there’s a major power failure while we’re shopping in this outdoor bazaar.

Louisa: How are we going to find our way back to the hotel?

Tommy: Follow me and stay close. I’ll lead the way.

Louisa: This road is so rough. I keep tripping over the stones. Ah!

Tommy: What happened?

Louisa: I just fell into something wet and sticky. Gross! I don’t know what it is. It has a weird texture.

Tommy: Don’t think about it. If you’re not hurt, then try to get up and keep moving. Give me your hand. Ugh, it’s all slimy!

Louisa: Yeah, and my dress is all greasy, too. You know what? I think I did hurt myself. My foot feels all tingly, like it’s asleep.

Tommy: Try to walk the best you can and let’s try to make it back to the hotel. The road is smooth, not too bumpy, on this side. Let me help you.

Louisa: Thanks. I think I’ll be okay. Well, I guess if we don’t get to see very much more of the city, we’ll at least know what it feels like.

### 0598 Suggesting a Nightcap

Brittany: [slurring her speech] I had a really nice time.

Tri: I’m glad to hear it. It was nice of Marie to set us up.

Brittany: Yeah, she told me that you would be my soul mate, and she was right! You’re dreamy…

Tri: Uh…well, thanks. It was really nice meeting you, but I’d better be going.

Brittany: What? Why are you leaving so soon? Don’t you want to come in for a nightcap? Let’s have a drink, or two, or three. I’ll make it worth your while…

Tri: I think we’ve both had enough to drink tonight, don’t you? I’ll just take a rain check.

Brittany: Don’t go yet. The night is young. Don’t you want to see my apartment?

Tri: Sure I do, but let’s make it another time. I really do have to go.

Brittany: Spoilsport!

…

Brittany seemed nice when I first met her, but that impression didn’t last long. It only took 15 minutes for me to realize that she and I had nothing in common, and then, I couldn’t get out of there fast enough. You might think I’m crazy because she really was drop-dead gorgeous, but I had no intention of taking advantage of a drunk woman!

### 0599 Shopping for Warm-Weather Clothes

Spencer: I would love to see you in this outfit: a tank top and a miniskirt.

Lauren: No way! I wouldn’t look anything like that mannequin. I’m too shy and I’d make a fool of myself wearing such revealing clothes.

Spencer: That’s where you’re wrong. You would look great on the beach in that outfit with a bikini underneath.

Lauren: I haven’t worn a bikini in years. I always wear a one-piece now. In fact, I’d feel more comfortable in a T-shirt, cut-offs, and flip-flops.

Spencer: Why would you want to hide that figure? If you want to do that, why don’t you just wear this Hawaiian shirt and these board-shorts. Then no one will know you’re a woman!

Lauren: Don’t get mad. Okay, you can pick out an outfit for me and I promise to wear it for you. Okay?

Spencer: Fine, but I’m warning you: I want to see some skin!

### 0600 Talking About Sight

Sue: This medication I’m taking is messing with my vision. Everything is blurry.

Hamed: That’s a good reason for you to stay home from work today.

Sue: I can’t. I have to give a presentation this afternoon and I can’t flake out on my coworkers.

Hamed: What good are you to them if you’re blind as a bat?

Sue: Everybody else will have crystal clear vision, so all I have to do is to put in an appearance. Things may not be as sharp as I’d like them to be, but I can still make out people and objects – as long as they’re really big.

Hamed: I don’t think your coworkers are going to want you to blindside them today with your strange behavior. You’re going to do more harm than good.

Sue: I can see well enough. I only see double if I move my head like this. Whoa…

Hamed: At this point, I don’t care if you have X-ray vision. That medication is affecting more than your vision. It’s impairing your better judgment!

### 0601 Paying an Unexpected Visit

Lorraine: Hi, this is a surprise. To what do I owe this pleasure?

Terrance: Can’t I just drop in on my little sister unannounced to see how she is? I was just in this neck of the woods and thought I would pay you a visit.

Lorraine: Sure you were. Of course, I’m glad to see you, but this is just a little out of the blue.

Terrance: What do you mean?

Lorraine: I haven’t seen you in over five months, and you just happened to be in the neighborhood?

Terrance: Well, I wasn’t exactly in the neighborhood, but I wanted to see my favorite sister.

Lorraine: Your only sister. Okay, out with it. What are you doing here?

Terrance: Uh, well, I was thinking of taking a year off from school to pursue my art. I really feel I need to devote some time to my painting to see if I can make it as an artist.

Lorraine: Mom and Dad are not going to like that.

Terrance: I know and that’s where you come in.

Lorraine: You want me to run interference for you with Mom and Dad.

Terrance: Yeah, they would take it a lot better coming from you, don’t you think?

Lorraine: No, I don’t.

Terrance: You’ve always been the responsible one…I’m just saying…

Lorraine: And I’m just saying that I’m not going to do your dirty work for you!

### 0602 Calling an Ambulance

Brad: Are you all right?

Lydia: What…what happened?

Brad: You lost consciousness and someone called 911. My name is Brad and I’m a paramedic. Can you answer a few questions for me?

Lydia: I’ll try.

Brad: Have you ever blacked out before?

Lydia: No, I don’t think so.

Brad: Do you have a history of medical problems? Do you have any allergies to medication?

Lydia: Not that I know of.

Brad: Okay. Where are you hurt? Are you in any pain?

Lydia: I think I hit my head when I fell down. Oh, it’s bleeding. Oh my God, I’m bleeding!

Brad: Stay calm and let me examine the wound.

Lydia: Oh my God, I’m going to bleed to death!

Brad: Try to stay still. The wound doesn’t look too serious, but we’ll get you to the hospital to get checked out. We’ll get a stretcher so we can get you into the ambulance and take you to the emergency room. Try to stay calm.

Lydia: Calm? How can I stay calm when I’m bleeding to death? I need a helicopter to take me to the hospital right away. Call medivac!

Brad: Ma’am, you don’t need a helicopter. I’m just going to give you a little injection to help you with the pain and to help you relax.

Lydia: I’m going to die…I’m going to…

Brad: Phew!

### 0603 Praising a Performance

Claudia: Oh, that was so good. I’ve never seen anything better. Bravo! Bravo!

Javier: There’s no need for a standing ovation and stop gushing. The performers did a passable job. It was nothing to write home about.

Claudia: You are so jaded. That performance was genius. It took my breath away.

Javier: I thought the first number was okay, and none of the dancers embarrassed themselves, but that’s all I can say about it.

Claudia: I’m sure they’d thank you for that faint praise. Me? I’ve never seen anything better.

Javier: Now how can you say that? That’s just over the top.

Claudia: If I can’t be effusive, who can? How many times will we see our granddaughter in a school play?

Javier: She’s seven years old and she played a tomato!

Claudia: Yes, but don’t forget: she played the lead tomato!

### 0604 Harming a Professional Reputation

Alex: Good morning. What’s with the gloom and doom?

Paige: Have you seen this morning’s newspaper?

Alex: No, I haven’t.

Paige: You’d better read this. It’s an article about our company.

Alex: Let me see that. This is outrageous! How can anybody print such lies? We’re not on the verge of going under. How did they get a hold of so much misleading and outright wrong information?

Paige: What I’m irate about is what it says about you, as the owner. The article is full of innuendos about your background. It’s nothing short of character assassination. We’ll sue the paper for defamation of character.

Alex: I’m not worried about my personal reputation. I’m more concerned about the company’s image. I’m going down to that paper and making them print a retraction.

Paige: How’re you going to do that?

Alex: After I call the reporter a no-good mudslinger, I’ll give him the facts, the ones he neglected to include in this story.

Paige: Be careful what you say to him, especially in front of his coworkers. You don’t want him suing you for slander!

### 0605 Talking About Astronomy

Dad: What are you working on, honey?

Mariko: It’s a project for school about the Earth and its place in the universe. I have to write a report and build a model of what scientists can see with a telescope in space.

Dad: I can help you with that. I was always good in science, especially astronomy.

Mariko: Okay, Dad. If I need help, I’ll ask you.

Dad: Is that the report you’re writing right now?

Mariko: Yes.

Dad: Make sure you include all of the planets in the solar system.

Mariko: I plan to, Dad.

Dad: Don’t forget to talk about the Big Bang. Oh yeah, and talk about traveling through space and how many light years it would take. Are you going to include stars, asteroids, and other galaxies in your model?

Mariko: No, the teacher didn’t say we had to.

Dad: Yes, but including some of those would set your project apart from the others, don’t you think?

Mariko: Sure, Dad.

Dad: It would be out of this world!

Mariko: Right, Dad.

### 0606 Reading a Bus Schedule

This was my first visit to McQuillanville. I wanted to avoid driving, so I decided to take the bus around the city. However, I was having some trouble figuring out the bus schedule.

Louisa: Excuse me, could you help me read this bus schedule?

Curt: I can try. Where do you want to go?

Louisa: I want to go downtown, but I’m not sure which bus to take.

Curt: Let me see that bus schedule. Here’s a listing of the route numbers on the back of this schedule. Look for a bus that goes downtown.

Louisa: Oh, I see. That’s great. Tomorrow, I want to arrive at the Podcast Museum at 10 a.m. when it opens. Which bus will I have to take?

Curt: Let me look at this bus schedule. That’s simple. All you have to do is find the stop closest to the museum, then look down the column to find the arrival time of 10 a.m. or before, and work backwards to see what time that bus passes the stop at your starting point. Got it?

Louisa: I think so, but I don’t think there’s a bus that goes directly from here to downtown.

Curt: In that case, it says on the schedule that you’ll need to get a transfer from the driver of the first bus so you can ride for free on the second bus. Just take the additional time into account. Mornings are peak times, and according to this schedule, the buses run more frequently to accommodate commuters, so it shouldn’t take you a lot longer. It also says here that you’ll need to have a bus pass or exact change for the fare when you board.

Louisa: Thanks a lot for all the help. Do you know how much the fare is?

Curt: I have no idea. I’ve never ridden the bus before in McQuillanville.

Louisa: Then how do you know so much about riding the bus?

Curt: I can read.

### 0607 Being Pestered on the Phone

Gisele: Our phone has been ringing off the hook all weekend. What’s the deal?

Nobu: I think it’s Jeanine.

Gisele: Jeanine…Jeanine…Is that the woman you’ve been going out with?

Nobu: Yeah, it’s her. I tried to let her down easy, but she’s not taking the hint.

Gisele: I see. That’s why you’ve been screening calls. Why don’t you just talk to her and tell her that you don’t think you’re right for each other, take the direct approach?

Nobu: I figure if I don’t take her calls for a few more days, she’ll get the message.

Gisele: Are you sure? There are 14 new voicemail messages. How many of those do you think are from Jeanine?

Nobu: All of them. I let calls go to voicemail if I see her phone number on caller ID. I guess I should listen to those messages – sooner or later.

Gisele: Yeah, that’s probably a good idea.

Nobu: I was thinking of taking the phone off the hook for the rest of day. What do you think?

Gisele: You do that and she’ll be on your doorstep to make sure nothing bad has happened to you. Listen, you don’t want to be honest with her, but you want her to stop pestering you, right? In that case, you only have one option.

Nobu: What?

Gisele: Tell her you’re moving to Timbuktu!

### 0608 Formatting Text

Chad: Okay, this report is finally finished.

Pamela: Oh, not quite. I’m still working on the formatting.

Chad: We used the standard formatting for this type of report. I don’t think we should play around with the text.

Pamela: Standard is boring. I want our report to be special. I’m putting a nice border on the cover, adding some shading, and centering some of the text.

Chad: No, I really think that’s a bad idea. All of the text should be flush left, and nobody else puts shading in their reports. It cuts down on readability.

Pamela: Readability is secondary to presentation. Look, I’m just putting some of the titles in caps and underlining them, adding some bullets, and putting some of the important sections in bold or italics. This will all make each page look more professional.

Chad: I don’t think it’s going to have your intended effect.

Pamela: Really?

Chad: Yes, instead of thinking we’re being professional, they’ll think we’ve gone off our rocker.

Pamela: Don’t be so stodgy. Hey, I think adding some clip art would really jazz things up, don’t you?

Chad: Oh, God!

### 0609 Types of Car and Vehicles

Robert: Hi, I’m Robert. What are you in the market for today?

Mary: I want to buy a new car, but I’m not sure what I want.

Robert: Well, you’ve come to the right place. We have a very large selection of cars and trucks – just about any type of vehicle you can think of. Why don’t I show you around?

Mary: Okay, that would be great.

Robert: Over here, we have some nice compacts and mid-size cars. We have two-door or four-door sedans, coupes, and hatchbacks. We even have this beautiful convertible sports car. What do you think?

Mary: It’s very nice, but I want something a little bigger for my family.

Robert: Okay, no sweat. Walk this way and you’ll see our station wagons, minivans, and SUVs. These seat anywhere from 6 to 10 people. We even have pickups.

Mary: I’m not sure if any of these will fit my family?

Robert: How many children do you have?

Mary: Eleven.

Robert: Eleven? In that case, you might want to buy two!

### 0610 Preparing to Travel

Shannon: It looks like you’re ready for your trip. You must be psyched.

Ignacio: Yeah, I am. I’m almost ready. I’ve gone to the post office and filled out a form so they’ll hold my mail while I’m gone.

Shannon: I could pick up your mail for you.

Ignacio: Thanks, but it’ll just be easier this way. I’ve also called the newspaper office to have my newspaper delivery suspended. Tomorrow I’ll arrange for my bank to automatically pay my bills so I won’t have my utilities cut off or accrue any late fees.

Shannon: I could pay your bills for you. I don’t mind.

Ignacio: It’s nice of you to offer, but I’ve got it covered. This morning, I took my plants over to my neighbor’s house. He agreed to water them for me while I’m gone.

Shannon: I could have come over and watered your plants. That wouldn’t have been a problem at all.

Ignacio: Thanks for being willing to do that. As always, you’re so helpful.

Shannon: Oh, I try my best…

Ignacio: I was wondering if I could ask just one favor from you.

Shannon: Of course you can. Just name it!

Ignacio: You know my dog, Rex…

Shannon: Oh, no…

Ignacio: I could board him at a kennel, but he’s had bad luck at kennels. Could you look after him while I’m gone?

Shannon: No way!

Ignacio: Why?

Shannon: Why don’t you ask the people who worked at those kennels where Rex has been? I’m willing to pitch in, but I’m no sucker!

### 0611 Having an Overbearing Father

Dad: Where are you going?

Eva: Out.

Dad: Out where?

Eva: Dad, I’m nearly a grown woman. You don’t need be so overbearing. You give me the third degree every time I leave the house.

Dad: As long as you live under my roof, you’ll live by my rules. Now, where are you going?

Eva: I’m going over to Damien’s house to hang out. I’ll be home before curfew.

Dad: I don’t like that guy, Damien. He’s not good enough for you. He’s a troublemaker. Mark my words: That kid is going nowhere fast. Is this a date?

Eva: No, Dad, we’re just going to watch a movie.

Dad: Alone? With no supervision? What is this world coming to?

Eva: Dad, we’re not kids anymore. We’re both 17.

Dad: That’s exactly the right age to get into the most trouble.

Eva: What are you doing?

Dad: I’m putting on my coat.

Eva: Why?

Dad: You and Damien need a chaperon.

Eva: No way, Dad! I’m not going over to Damien’s with you tagging along as our chaperon. That would be humiliating.

Dad: Good, then you’ll stay home. So, what movie should we watch tonight?

Eva: Huh!

### 0612 Introducing a Speaker

Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?

It is my great honor to introduce our guest speaker today. Our speaker is actually a person who needs no introduction, since she is well known in our field as one of its great innovators. Edwina Litton has been called a revolutionary thinker by those in our field. That’s because she has strived to bring attention to those issues that we believe are so important.

Dr. Litton holds four advanced degrees and has an honorary doctorate from Harward University. In her much-anticipated speech today, she will address what she sees as the future of our field.

Without further ado, please join me in welcoming Dr. Edwina Litton.

### 0613 Being a First-Time Parent

Zuly: Hello.

Ricardo: Hi, Zuly. How are you?

Zuly: Oh, Ricardo, it’s you. I’m doing okay. How are you?

Ricardo: I wanted to call and congratulate you on the birth of your new baby.

Zuly: Thanks a lot. Carla was born three weeks ago, and she was eight pounds, three ounces.

Ricardo: That’s great! How does it feel to be a first-time parent?

Zuly: It’s really overwhelming taking care of a newborn. I’m learning everything from scratch, everything from how to breastfeed and bottle-feed, to burping her, to putting her to bed, to using a car seat and a stroller.

Ricardo: You sound overwhelmed. I remember when Adam, our first child, was born. There were the feedings in the middle of the night, and all of those diapers!

Zuly: Exactly. I’m exhausted all the time. In fact, I find myself dozing off at all hours of the day.

Ricardo: I really sympathize with you, but these days will pass quickly, and then you’ll have such great memories. Have you had much sleep?

Zuly: Zzzzzzzz!

Ricardo: Zuly? Zuly?

### 0614 Experiencing an Earthquake

Jamal: Did you feel that?

Keisha: Was that an earthquake?

Jamal: Yes, I think so. Turn on the news.

Newscaster: “Reports are coming in about an earthquake that occurred at 4:35 p.m. in the downtown area. We spoke with a seismologist at the Earthquake Center and learned that the earthquake had a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale. The epicenter was near downtown, along one of the major faults, and the seismologist warns that there will be some aftershocks.”

Keisha: Phew! I’m glad the earthquake wasn’t a high-intensity one. I wish they could predict more accurately when those earthquakes are going to happen.

Jamal: Yeah, me, too. I’ve looked around the house and don’t see any damage, though. I guess our house won’t be declared a disaster area.

Keisha: Don’t be too sure. Considering the mess you’ve made in kitchen, it could easily be called a disaster area.

Jamal: In that case, will you be sending aid? I think I’m too tired to do the dishes.

Keisha: You won’t be getting any aid from me. If you’re hoping for a relief effort, you’d better ask the UN.

### 0615 Watching Daytime Talk Shows

Sally: Why are wasting your time on your day off watching these daytime talk shows?

Jerry: I think they’re entertaining.

Sally: You’ve got to be kidding. The only people who are booked as guests on those shows are losers or exhibitionists who want attention.

Jerry: No, they’re not. These shows are all about human drama and tragedy, something we can all relate to.

Sally: Give me a break! The people who appear on these shows want fame at any cost and the producers of the shows exploit them for ratings. They’re full of salacious details that nobody should talk about in public, and that I certainly don’t want to hear.

Jerry: I completely disagree. If you get off your high horse for a minute, you may learn something.

Sally: Like what?

Jerry: Like how to get rid of an annoying wife and get away with it!

### 0616 Having a Business Mentor

Alex: Where are you going?

Kenya: I’m going to meet my business mentor.

Alex: Your business mentor? What do you do with a business mentor?

Kenya: Well, my mentor is like an advisor. We meet regularly and I get her feedback and guidance with my ideas on starting a business.

Alex: Oh, so you’re her protégé?

Kenya: No, I’m not. I simply go to her with my ideas and she helps me hash them out. She’s a successful entrepreneur and I’m there to learn from her experience.

Alex: How did you get her to be your mentor? Were you already friends?

Kenya: No, I contacted her out of the blue, actually. I’ve read about her company and her many successes, and I wrote her a letter telling her about me and what I hope to accomplish. She agreed to meet with me, and at that first meeting, we really clicked and now we meet once a month.

Alex: That’s very generous of her. What does she get out of it?

Kenya: I’m not sure, but I think she enjoys giving me pointers and sharing her expertise. I’m very appreciative and she says I remind her a lot of herself when she was my age. I take that as a huge compliment.

Alex: You should. If you’re like her, you’ll be a multi-millionaire in no time flat.

### 0617 Buying Bathroom Supplies

Jan: We’re almost done. We just need to get some bathroom supplies for Kimberly.

Tim: Okay, here are some towels, a bathmat and a bathroom scale. Don’t forget the cleaning supplies. She’ll need some rubber gloves, disinfectant, bowl cleaner, and a plunger.

Jan: All right. We have all that. Where are you going?

Tim: She’ll need a soap dish and a toothbrush holder. She’ll need a trashcan, too.

Jan: Okay, I think we’re all done. Kimberly is moving into an apartment with college roommates, not starting her own bathroom supply store. Let’s not go overboard.

Tim: I just need to get a couple more things.

Jan: What?

Tim: I’m buying her 10 packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Kleenex. She’ll be living on her own for the first time and she’ll need all that.

Jan: Ten packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Kleenex?! She can shop for herself, you know. You don’t need to buy her a six-month supply.

Tim: Clearly you don’t know college students. They’ll go through that in a week!

### 0618 Eating at a Casual Restaurant

Russell: Why aren’t you eating? Is there something the matter with your food?

Nadia: No, the food is fine.

Russell: What’s wrong?

Nadia: I’m not sure how to put this. I really like going to diners and hole in the walls with you, and I love mom and pop restaurants as much as you do. For me, it’s the food that counts, not the ambiance, but…

Russell: I thought you’d love this place. It’s my favorite greasy spoon.

Nadia: I do like it. It’s just that when you invited me out for my birthday and said that it would be something really special, I thought you might take me somewhere else.

Russell: Is that why you wore that nice new dress? You thought I was taking you to a fancy restaurant, with tablecloths, mood lighting, and snooty waiters.

Nadia: Well…

Russell: This is much better, don’t you think? We get to sit in this comfortable booth, listen to the jukebox, and watch our food being cooked behind the counter. I can’t think of a better dining experience. Don’t you agree?

Nadia: Uh, sure.

Russell: And don’t think you’re not getting something special for your birthday. I planned it all ahead of time.

Nadia: You did? Really? What is it?

Russell: I ordered you a whole pie!

### 0619 Packing Clothes for a Trip

Nick: Aren’t you done packing yet? We need to leave for the airport in 15 minutes.

Mariah: I’m almost done. I just need to finish packing my garment bag.

Nick: You’re bringing a garment bag? What for?

Mariah: For my dresses, of course. I don’t want them to get wrinkles in them. I have a bag for shoes, belts, handbags, and other accessories; two suitcases for clothes, swimsuits, underwear, and socks; and a carry-on for my makeup and toiletries.

Nick: What do you need all that for?!

Mariah: I’m preparing for all contingencies. You never know what situation you’ll be in when you travel, and I want to be equipped with anything I’ll need.

Nick: I should have expected this when I married a clothes horse. I’m surprised you didn’t bring your entire wardrobe.

Mariah: I was thinking about it. I’m sure I can make room. All of my bags are expandable.

### 0620 Making Quick and Slow Decisions

Courteney: Which of these vendors do you think we should go with?

Dante: I’m really hesitant to make a decision until we’ve pondered the options a little longer. We don’t want to make any rash decisions.

Courteney: We’ve sat on this for long enough, don’t you think? I know you’re of two minds about whether we should be switching vendors in the middle of the year, but I think it’s the right move. We had sound reasons for doing this, remember?

Dante: Yes, yes, I know that it wasn’t a split-second decision, but whether it’ll really save us money is debatable.

Courteney: I have to disagree with you there. We’ve both seen the reports and I don’t think there are any ifs, ands, or buts about it. We’re going to save money.

Dante: Okay, I’m willing to make a tentative decision to go with GreatDeal Corp. as our new vendor, as long as that decision isn’t set in stone. We’ll revisit this decision in six months to see if they’re working out.

Courteney: I can live with that. Now, can we discuss my raise?

Dante: Raise? That’s definitely something I’ll need to ponder a lot more.

### 0621 Picking a Fight

I was sitting at my local bar waiting for my friends to arrive to watch the game. Two guys sitting a few seats away kept giving me strange looks, and one of them said, “What are you looking at?” I looked around to make sure that he was speaking to me, and before I could respond he said, “You want a piece of me? You and what army? Let’s take it outside.”

By this time, I realized that this guy was trying to pick a fight with me and I wasn’t sure what to do. I was hoping that I could make peace with him or at least hold him off until my friends got there.

I said to him, “I’m just sitting over here minding my own business. I’m not trying to get in your face. I don’t have a problem with you. Let’s just chill out and I’ll buy you and your friend a drink.” He didn’t seem to like what I’d said.

“Chill out?” he said. “I don’t need to chill out. Those are fighting words. Let’s take this outside. I want to see you running with your tail between your legs.” He got up and started to walk toward me.

Just then, my friends arrived. When the man saw my six friends walking toward me, he stopped in his tracks. I think he was weighing his odds and doubting his own chances. He turned around and said something to his friend, and then they both got up and walked out the door.

That was a narrow escape. I had never been so happy to see my friends as I was at that moment. Needless to say, the first round was on me.

### 0622 Having Well- and Badly-Behaved Children

Josephine: Hello.

Ray: Hi, Josephine, it’s Ray. We have a meeting today at 10 a.m. and I was wondering if you would mind if I brought my kids with me. Their babysitter didn’t show up.

Josephine: Oh, sure. That’s no problem. Your children are so well-behaved. Even at their age, they have impeccable manners.

Ray: Well, they’re not always little angels, but they’re not too much of a handful, thank goodness.

Josephine: You know what they say: Girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice…

Ray: It is probably a little easier with two girls. I feel sorry for my mother who raised six boys.

Josephine: Six boys!

Ray: Yeah, and before we were born, my father thought that children should be seen but not heard. Was he in for a rude awakening! We were all very unruly. Imagine six boys only one year apart. We got yelled at a lot for being naughty.

Josephine: But that’s how boys are, aren’t they? Girls are different. They’re quiet, sweet, and even-tempered. What’s that noise?

Ray: That noise is my daughters creating a ruckus fighting tooth and nail over a toy. So much for quiet, sweet, and even-tempered!

### 0623 A Hit-and-Run Accident

Flora: What happened to my car?!

Saul: I saw it happen. A car came around the corner and hit the back of your car.

Flora: Didn’t the driver stop?

Saul: No, it was hit-and-run. The driver just took off. He was driving like a bat out of hell. It looks like he caused some damage.

Flora: Some damage?! My car is totaled. I hope whoever it was gets his license revoked. Better yet, I hope the judge throws the book at him and he does jail time. But how are the police going to catch someone who leaves the scene of the crime like this? That guy must be a real jerk!

Saul: Take it easy. Maybe he just panicked. It’s probably his first offense. Maybe he’s young and just learning how to drive.

Flora: Maybe…Hey, why are you defending the driver?

Saul: Well…

Flora: You know the person driving the car, don’t you? You’re not an innocent bystander. You’re trying to talk me out of calling the police!

Saul: Well, I have this nephew who sometimes borrows my car, and he drives too fast. He did hit your car, but it’s a simple fender bender.

Flora: Fender bender?! My car is totaled.

Saul: I’m sure it’s not as bad as it looks. If you don’t call the police, I’ll make sure it’s repaired. It’ll be as good as new.

Flora: Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?

Saul: No, not at all. I’ll get your car fixed, right after I wring my nephew’s neck!

### 0624 Advantages and Disadvantages in Life

Andy: Doesn’t it make you sick? We bust our butts around here and the boss brings in his nephew to be the new manager.

Nia: You never know. He may be a good boss.

Andy: I doubt it. He’s getting this opportunity just because he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He didn’t have to pull himself up by his bootstraps like the rest of us.

Nia: I’m going to wait and see how he is as a manager. I’m hoping to be pleasantly surprised.

Andy: If you’re a blue blood like he is, born into privilege and old money, you can do no wrong.

Nia: That’s not true. He’ll be held accountable for how this department performs.

Andy: But when does somebody like me get a break? Okay, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks. I grew up in a white trash neighborhood. So what? I’ve worked hard to get where I am now. That guy hasn’t paid his dues like I have.

Nia: You can complain all you want, but it doesn’t change the situation. He’s the new boss and we work for him. Get used to it.

Andy: Get used to it?! Not on your life!

### 0625 Being Famous and Anonymous

Erik: Why are you wearing that getup?

Juliana: I’m trying to stay under the radar. I don’t want to create a mob by going outside without a disguise. People are going to recognize me.

Erik: So? Are you trying to tell me that you think you’re famous after being in one play?

Juliana: Of course! I’ve had my name in lights and I have to expect people to know who I am. Losing my privacy is the price of fame. Everybody knows that.

Erik: I think you may be overestimating the size of your adoring public. How many people went to see your play?

Juliana: Enough. By tomorrow, the newspapers will have my picture plastered across their pages and I’ll have to say good-bye to my anonymity.

Erik: If the papers don’t come out until tomorrow, why are you going around incognito?

Juliana: I’m just getting ready to meet my fans.

Erik: Depending on whether the reviews are good or bad, you may be famous – or infamous.

### 0626 Wiring Money to Another Country

Mahmoud: My brother emailed about an emergency situation. He needs $300 by tomorrow, but how can I get cash to him within 24 hours if I’m here in Mexico City and he’s in New York?

Sharon: That’s easy. You can wire him the money from here and he can pick it up immediately there.

Mahmoud: You mean wire him money through the bank? I already checked with my bank and it’ll take at least five days for them to process the wire.

Sharon: You can just use a private wire service like Western Union and the money will be available to him immediately. I wire money all the time using Western Union. Here is a blank form. I can help you fill it out if you want me to.

Mahmoud: That would be great. Hey, this form is for a money transfer. Is that the same thing as a wire?

Sharon: Yes, it’s the same thing. Fill out the receiver or recipient information here and the sender information there.

Mahmoud: Can I pay in local currency? I don’t have that much cash in U.S. dollars.

Sharon: Sure. When you go to the Western Union office, they’ll calculate how much you’ll have to pay according to the current exchange rate.

Mahmoud: Is there a fee?

Sharon: Yeah, there is, and it’s a little higher if you want the money to be available immediately. If you have more time, you could save a little by using the slower service that makes the money available in three business days. All done?

Mahmoud: Yeah, I think so. Now what?

Sharon: Now you take this to the nearest Western Union office. They’ll give you a copy of this form with a control number. Your brother can use that control number to pick up the money from any Western Union office in New York.

Mahmoud: Sharon, you’re a lifesaver.

Sharon: So, what’s the emergency?

Mahmoud: Tickets go on sale tomorrow for my favorite baseball team. My brother and I have to get tickets.

Sharon: That’s the emergency?!

Mahmoud: For us, it’s a matter of life and death.

### 0627 Being Spontaneous or Well-Planned

Mariela: Wow, it looks like you’re working on a big project. What are all these pages and pages of notes for?

Will: I’m preparing for my date with Christine. I want everything to be well-planned and to go without a hitch.

Mariela: Okay, but I still don’t understand why you’re making such detailed plans.

Will: I want to be ready for every contingency. For instance, I planned a picnic, but if it rains, I’ll take her to lunch at the Garden Café instead.

Mariela: Don’t you think you’re taking the spontaneity out of your date? Why don’t you play it by ear? I know you don’t like to fly by the seat of your pants, but maybe she’ll have some ideas about what she’d like to do.

Will: Oh, I’ve taken her preferences into account. If she wants to do something active, we can go bowling or take a long walk. If she prefers something more passive, we’ll go to a movie.

Mariela: Well, it sounds like you’ve mapped out every possible alternative. Hey, what’s this?

Will: Give me that!

Mariela: I see you’ve mapped out more than just your date. You mapped out the entire trajectory of your life together: Get married in two years, have your first child two years after that…

Will: That is not meant for you. And plus, it’s just a tentative plan…

Mariela: You mean Christine will have some say in it?

Will: I may let her pick our children’s names. Now, get out of here, will ya?!

### 0628 Introducing a New Product

Augie: Today’s the day. I’m giving you the heads up. Our company is rolling out its new line of cell phones.

Lillian: I can see you’re excited about it. What’s so special about the new products?

Augie: This line of phones has state-of-the-art technology and never-before-seen features. It’s been in development for over a year and it’s been really hard keeping it under wraps.

Lillian: I thought information was leaked weeks ago.

Augie: Those were just rumors, and the company put a clamp on those pretty quickly.

Lillian: Wasn’t the new line supposed to come out next month?

Augie: That was the original plan, but since McQ Corp. is coming out with its own line of phones soon, we wanted to get a jump on them.

Lillian: And steal their thunder.

Augie: Yes, and steal their thunder. We had to scramble to get the phones ready ahead of schedule, but I think it was worth it. They’re really going to make a splash.

Lillian: I hope so. I hope all of this hype has been justified.

Augie: Oh, it will be. I’ll know soon enough.

Lillian: How?

Augie: You’ll be begging me to get you one.

### 0629 Being Hungry and Full

Steve: I’m finally home and I’m hungry. What’s for dinner?

Brandy: I’m making a new dish. I think you’re really going to like it.

Steve: Oh, good. Bring it on.

Brandy: Well, I miscalculated the cooking time a little and it’s going to take longer than I originally planned. I know you’re famished. Here’s a snack for you to munch on while you wait.

Steve: I’m half-starved. I skipped lunch and had to work late.

Brandy: I know, but I also know you’re dying for something really good. I promise that it’ll be worth the wait.

Steve: Okay, but I could eat a horse right now. Bring me something else to snack on.

Brandy: Don’t be too greedy and eat too much. I don’t want you to spoil your appetite. I know that what I’m cooking is something you’ve been craving for a long time, and you want to save your appetite for it.

Steve: All right. I’ll wait. How much longer will it be?

Brandy: Oh, maybe another hour or a little longer…

Steve: Another hour?! I’ll be dead and buried by then!

### 0630 Making a Medical Diagnosis

Terrell: Where have you been?

Sally: At the hospital, again. My doctor is putting me through another battery of tests.

Terrell: She still hasn’t been able to zero in on the cause of your pain and make a diagnosis?

Sally: No, she hasn’t. Part of the problem is that my symptoms are intermittent, and they seem to flare up only when I’m not under observation. The symptoms themselves are ambiguous, so finding the root cause hasn’t been easy.

Terrell: I can see how that would be mystifying and frustrating. Are you still in a lot of pain?

Sally: The mild pain in my legs seems to be chronic, but the severe pain in my back is occasional.

Terrell: I guess you’re not up for going out tonight.

Sally: After a day of being poked and prodded like a guinea pig, all I want to do is to curl up with a hot cup of tea and a good book!

### 0631 Customizing a Personal Webpage

Keiko: The layout of your webpage is so lame. Why don’t you customize it?

Al: Why bother? I don’t want to spend the time or the energy.

Keiko: Let me show you my page. Check out this background. Don’t you think it’s great?

Al: Yeah, it’s great. Can I get back to my book now?

Keiko: You haven’t even looked at my page. Look at this. You can add all kinds of graphics and you can use the profile editor to list information about yourself: your hometown, your likes and dislikes, your relationship status, your mood, everything! You can link to or upload photos and videos, too. I even have a custom cursor and this scrolling text across the top

Al: Yeah, it’s all great, but kind of dizzying.

Keiko: You haven’t even seen my animated gifs. This funny baby will dance across the page, look!

Al: Thanks for the suggestions, but I think I’ll stick to a simple, uncluttered page. How long did it take you to do all of that?

Keiko: How long? Maybe a few hours.

Al: I’d rather spend a few hours reading a good book.

Keiko: Suit yourself. Maybe that’s why you have 22 “friends” and I have 200.

Al: Clearly your time has been better spent.

### 0632 Negotiating a Business Deal

Gia: Why are the negotiations on this deal taking so long? I thought we would be putting the finishing touches on it by now.

Logan: The other side is holding out for more concessions. I don’t know what they’re thinking. They made some pretty big demands at the start and I think we’ve given in to most of them. Now they’re countering with even more demands.

Gia: They probably know that they have us over a barrel. After all of the time and money we’ve put into this deal, they know that we don’t want to walk away.

Logan: That’s true and that’s why we’re still at the table, but they may be pushing too hard. In the end, I don’t think we’ll cave on those additional concessions.

Gia: So the entire thing is touch-and-go right now?

Logan: That’s how I would characterize it. If I were you, I wouldn’t make any long-term plans.

Gia: Duly noted. I won’t run out and buy that new house and those three new cars.

### 0633 Moving Out of a Home

[A knock on door.]

Andre: Hello. Is anyone here?

Ellie: Yes, can I help you?

Andre: I saw your door open and I just wanted to make sure everything was okay. Did you just move in?

Ellie: No, I’m moving out. As you can see, I’m doing last-minute packing. I think I’ve used up 10 rolls of packing tape!

Andre: This looks like a major undertaking. Are you moving yourself?

Ellie: No, the movers are coming with the moving van tomorrow morning. I’m moving a few things into storage, and I’ll take a few of the perishables and essentials in my car, but they’ll be doing the heavy lifting. No loading for me. Before they come, though, I need to disassemble this desk and this bookcase. It’ll be a long afternoon.

Andre: I can see that. Are you moving far?

Ellie: No, I’m only moving about a mile from here to another apartment.

Andre: Oh, so you’re not moving out of the area.

Ellie: No, I’m not.

Andre: I’m glad to hear that. Let’s make a deal: I’ll help you disassemble your furniture if you’ll promise to invite me over to your new place sometime.

Ellie: Really? Are you sure you’re willing to do that?

Andre: Sure. Hand me those tools and I’ll have it done in no time.

Ellie: Boy, am I glad I left my door open.

Andre: Yeah, so am I.

### 0634 Resembling One’s Parents

Khaled: Hi, what are you looking at?

Susanna: Your photo albums. Your roommate let me in and said I could make myself comfortable while I waited for you.

Khaled: There are some really incriminating pictures in there. You’d better give those back to me.

Susanna: Not yet! I’m looking at your baby pictures and your family portraits. You’re the spitting image of your mother.

Khaled: That’s not my mother. That was our neighbor.

Susanna: Oh, now that I look a little closer, I can see that you resemble your father. You’re a chip off the old block.

Khaled: That’s not my father. That’s my father’s friend. Now, why don’t I take those…

Susanna: Wait! These candids of your birthday parties are so cute! You were so adorable!

Khaled: Right. When I was a kid, I had a face only a mother could love.

Susanna: That’s not true! You have a great profile. I’d expect to see your likeness in paintings and on statues.

Khaled: Okay, enough with the brown-nosing. What do you really want?

Susanna: I don’t want anything…okay, just one little thing. My cousin is in town. I want to go out with Rick tonight and I thought we could double date. Me, Rick, my cousin…and you. What do you say?

Khaled: I knew it had to be something. Does she look like you?

Susanna: We are like two peas in a pod.

Khaled: Then, forget it!

Susanna: Hmph!

### 0635 Arranging Airport Transfer

My wife and I bought a vacation package and we thought that it included everything. We should have double-checked that it included airport transfer to our hotel as well. Hindsight is 20/20, they say.

My wife wanted to take a taxi, but I nixed that idea. It would cost an arm and a leg. I wanted a cheaper option so we went to ask about it at the airport information desk.

…

Don: Hello, my wife and I need to get to our hotel downtown. What are our options?

Clerk: Well, you could take a taxi.

Don: We’re hoping to find a cheaper option.

Clerk: Okay, in that case, a limo service would be out, too. There are private shuttle services, but since you’re so far from downtown, you’ll be making a lot of stops and it will take a long time to get there. You could also take public transportation – the bus or the subway – but that’ll take even longer. Doesn’t your hotel have a courtesy shuttle?

Don: I never thought of that.

Clerk: Many downtown hotels do. Call your hotel and they’ll be able to tell you. They’ll probably have the best suggestion on how to get there, too, if they don’t have their own shuttle. If you decide on a private shuttle service or to take public transportation, come back and I’ll give you more information.

Don: Thanks a lot. I’ll give the hotel a call right now.

…

Lucky for us, the hotel had a courtesy shuttle and it was on its way. Good thing, too, since I didn’t relish spending any more time at the airport after a long red-eye!

### 0636 Being Lazy and Energetic

Carmen: Wake up! You’re supposed to be working.

Elias: Shhh, I’m trying to sleep. The boss is out of the office today, so I consider it a holiday. Today, I can be a little out of it if I want to be.

Carmen: Out of it? You’re sleeping on the job – literally!

Elias: So what? Aren’t you feeling a little tired on a Monday morning?

Carmen: I admit I’m a little sluggish, but that’s no reason to fall down on the job. We both have work to get done and I’m doing it.

Elias: What’s wrong with you? Why are you so hyper? I’m as hard working as the next guy, but I’m not going to jump through hoops when the boss is away.

Carmen: You, hard working? Don’t make me laugh! You’d better get back to work or when the boss gets back, he’ll call you a slacker again.

Elias: Okay, I’m learning by your example. I’m now as energetic and productive as you are.

Carmen: Yeah? Doing what?

Elias: Telling my co-worker she’s a pain in the neck!

### 0637 Planting Flowers and Trees

Zuly: Hurry up! Mom will be home any minute and we’re not done planting.

Eric: Whose idea was it anyway to plant a garden for Mom for her birthday? We’ve been working under this hot sun all day and the smell of the fertilizer is really getting to me.

Zuly: It was our idea, remember? We both wanted to give Mom something special this year. Look, we’re almost done. We’ve already picked the weeds, prepared the soil, and dug the holes for the new seeds and flowers. I’m taking the flowers out of their pots now and I’ll have them in the ground in a minute. After that, all we have left to do is to plant the new tree. Keep digging!

Eric: Are you sure the hole needs to be this deep?

Zuly: Yes, the book says that the roots need to have room to grow. That’s the perfect place for it, too. It’ll get a lot of direct sunlight.

Eric: Great, but my arms are so tired, they’re about to fall off.

Zuly: Move over. I’ll dig for a while. Why don’t you water the new flowers?

Eric: Sure, right after I take a little break. In the meantime, I’ll supervise. Come on. Keep digging. You’re almost there…

Zuly: I think you’d better keep your mouth shut, or I’ll think of some new uses for that fertilizer!

### 0638 Fire and Firefighters

Rebecca: Look, there’s smoke coming from six stories up.

Hugh: Yes, I know. Didn’t you hear the fire alarm go off upstairs a few minutes ago?

Rebecca: No, but I’m really glad there’s a fire station only a few blocks away. Hey look, there’s the fire engine. Here come the firefighters!

Hugh: Yeah, let’s get back to work. I’m sure they’ll have the blaze under control pretty quickly.

Rebecca: How can you work with all of this excitement? Maybe I should get the fire extinguisher from the hallway and go upstairs to help.

Hugh: I think that’s a really bad idea. You can see for yourself that the firefighters are getting ready to fight the fire. They’re getting the ladder out and attaching the fire hose to the hydrant. Anyway, it’s probably just a false alarm.

Rebecca: If the smoke detector went off then I’m sure there’s a fire. We’ll know if we start to see something burning near a window or ashes coming down.

Hugh: I’ve never seen you like this before. Why are you so excited?

Rebecca: I wanted to be a firefighter when I grew up. I’ve always had a fascination with fire.

Hugh: Ah, that explains it. Would it make you feel better if I lit up a cigarette?

### 0639 Ordering Soups and Salads

After a long tiring day at work, I stopped at a restaurant nearby for a quick meal.

Server: Hi, I’m Ursula. Can I get you something to drink?

Paulo: Yes, I’d like an iced tea and I’m also ready to order. I’ll just have a bowl of soup and a salad.

Server: Sure, no problem. What kind of soup would you like? We have chicken noodle, minestrone, and cream of mushroom.

Paulo: Do you have something that’s hearty?

Server: If you want something hearty, I would suggest our clam chowder or beef stew.

Paulo: I’ll take a bowl of beef stew.

Server: Great! What kind of salad would you like: a chef salad, Caesar salad, or Cobb salad?

Paulo: I’ll just have a garden salad.

Server: Okay, what kind of dressing would you like?

Paulo: What kind do you have?

Server: We have French, Italian, ranch, Thousand Island, and vinaigrette.

Paulo: Do you have blue cheese?

Server: Oh yes, I forgot to mention blue cheese. Okay, that’s a bowl of beef stew and a garden salad with blue cheese dressing. Will that be all?

Paulo: Yes, that’s all.

…

By the time I had finished placing my order, I was even more tired. Do you sometimes feel that life gives you too many choices?

### 0640 Being Genuine and False

Javier: I saw Terry cozying up to you this morning. What was that about?

Floriane: He was just offering me some advice on my first proposal.

Javier: Sure, he was. What were his true intentions?

Floriane: I think he was being upfront about wanting to help a new employee. I don’t think he had an ulterior motive.

Javier: I wouldn’t take Terry at face value. He has a reputation around the office of being two-faced. He’ll try to get to know you under false pretenses and then stab you in the back.

Floriane: I don’t get that feeling from Terry. He seemed genuine and open. By the way, was there something you needed?

Javier: Me? No. I was just trying to watch out for you.

Floriane: In that case, I’d better get back to work, and I’ll keep your warning in mind. I’ll beware of anyone giving me advice who may have an ulterior motive.

### 0641 Sharing With Others

Benny: Mom says we’re supposed to share.

Julia: I know. I’m divvying up the candy right now. Just hold your horses.

Benny: I want to do it. I want to make sure I get my fair share.

Julia: I called dibs on dividing up the candy, remember? You snooze you lose.

Benny: That’s not fair! I wasn’t here when Mom came home.

Julia: Bummer for you. Okay, I’m done. Here’s your share and here’s mine.

Benny: Hey, the two piles aren’t equal. You definitely got the lion’s share. You do that to me every time. That’s not fair!

Julia: What are you going to do about it?

Benny: I’m going to tell!

Julia: You’re such a baby. Okay, if you don’t run to Mom, I’ll let you call shotgun the next time we go anywhere in the car.

Benny: You will? You promise?

Julia: I cross my heart and hope to die. Okay?

Benny: All right, but I still want my fair share of the candy.

Julia: Okay, I’ve evened out the piles. Satisfied?

Benny: Yeah. And can I do the divvying up next time?

Julia: Don’t push your luck!

### 0642 Installing Windows and Doors

Vern: I really think we’ve bitten off more than we can chew. I like do-it-yourself projects, but installing a new window and a new door isn’t as easy as it looks.

Genevive: What we don’t know, we’ll learn as we go. Okay, we’ve removed the old window. This new double-paned one is going to be great and it’ll slide open and close easily, unlike the old one. We just need to put in a new frame first, and then we can move it into place.

Vern: You make it sound so easy. Is the screen going to fit? It looks too big.

Genevive: Oh sure, it’ll fit.

Vern: This latch doesn’t seem to be working.

Genevive: It’ll work once it’s installed. Come on, give me a hand. Hmm…the new window doesn’t seem to fit exactly. I’m not sure what the problem is. Let me think about it. Let’s move on to the door and come back to it later.

Vern: Are you sure?

Genevive: Sure, I’m sure. Installing the new door will be easier and we can get it out of the way.

Vern: Maybe we should wait until the window is installed. If we can’t finish installing the window and the door before nightfall, it’ll be a very cold night in the house.

Genevive: Don’t worry. Let’s see, first we have to remove the old door without damaging the jamb. The hinges are rusted; it seems to be stuck. Oh, I think it’s finally coming off.

Vern: See? Replacing the door isn’t going to be as easy as you thought, is it?

Genevive: I got it off in the end, didn’t I?

Vern: Yes, but will you be able to put in the new one before I die of frostbite?

### 0643 Liberal and Conservative News

Bill: Why are you reading that rag?

Rachel: I enjoy reading it. I like its news coverage and its incisive commentaries.

Bill: That’s nothing but a liberal propaganda rag. You can’t believe a thing they print in there.

Rachel: That’s not true. The news stories are objective and unbiased. This magazine isn’t like the newspapers and news websites you read. Those are run by ultraconservative reactionaries, who only know how to write diatribes. If I only read the news sources you read, I would think that this world was being ruled by liberals.

Bill: The world is being ruled by liberals, at least by the liberal press.

Rachel: You’ve got to be kidding! Our politics and our financial system are run by staunch conservatives, who ignore any point of view other than their own. Those of us who are enlightened…

Bill: You call yourselves enlightened? All you and your dyed-in-the-wool liberals want to do is to tear down old traditions.

Rachel: Yes, we do want to tear down old traditions, old traditions that keep us from making progress toward…

Sophia: Mom, Dad, what’s going on in here? Why are you yelling?

Rachel: Oh, it’s nothing, honey. Go back to sleep. Your Dad and I are just having a friendly little talk.

### 0644 Giving a Successful Presentation

Event organizer: Do you hear that? It’s a packed house and your presentation was a hit. People are clamoring for more.

Herman: I can’t believe it. I wasn’t expecting that kind of reception. The audience really seemed to like it.

Event organizer: Like it? They were on the edge of their seats.

Herman: The presentation actually started slowly, but it seemed to gain traction in the middle.

Event organizer: You had the audience hooked from the start. You could have heard a pin drop in there when you were going over your main points. Your presentation is undoubtedly the highlight of the conference.

Herman: Thanks. I’m still in shock. Maybe if I tweaked it a little, I could give this presentation at the national conference.

Event organizer: You’ll have time later to think about that. Right now, you need to get out there for the Q&A. They’re waiting for you.

Herman: But I don’t have anything else to say.

Event organizer: Just get out there. Your adoring public is waiting for you!

### 0645 Shaving Your Face

I forgot to set my alarm last night and I woke up later than usual. I was tempted to skip my morning shave, but I hate having long stubble all day. I like to be clean-shaven every day. I’m the kind of guy who gets a five-o’clock shadow early in the afternoon, so if I skipped my morning shave, I’d look like I was growing a beard by the end of the day.

I went into the bathroom and picked up my shaving cream. I lathered up my face and checked to see that my razor was sharp and that I didn’t need to replace the razor blades. There’s nothing worse than trying to shave with a dull razor. I tried using an electric razor for a while, but I could never get a close enough shave.

I tried to focus on shaving my neck, chin, and cheeks. I was in too much of a hurry, though, and nicked myself on the neck. I hate it when that happens! I knew I was in too much of a hurry, but I was going to be really late. Oh, I did it again! This time I nicked myself on the chin. “Okay,” I said to myself, “slow down. You’d rather be a little late to work than to end up with a face full of potholes, right?”

### 0646 War-Related Disabilities

Elena: How do you like your new job at the Veteran’s Hospital?

Wieland: I like it a lot. It’s really rewarding.

Elena: What do you do there, exactly?

Wieland: My job is to help returning vets who have been physically injured adjust to living with their medical disabilities.

Elena: You mean people who have lost limbs?

Wieland: Yes, some of the vets have had one or more limbs amputated. But that’s only one of the many disabilities we see at the hospital. For instance, this week I’m working with a vet who suffered serious hearing loss and a woman who has developed a visual impairment.

Elena: It sounds like a very hard job.

Wieland: It can be, but it’s also inspiring sometimes. I’ve seen people who are paralyzed – paraplegics and quadriplegics – overcome their disabilities and lead full and happy lives. With the help of wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, seeing-eye dogs, and modified cars, a lot of people with disabilities can learn to be independent. That’s part of my job.

Elena: Then you’re just the person I need to help my brother.

Wieland: Is he disabled?

Elena: Yes, he has a serious case of paralysis, caused by extreme laziness. Is there any help for him?

### 0647 Using a Smartphone

Hitomi: What are you unboxing?

Jason: This is my new smartphone. It has every feature under the sun!

Hitomi: Every feature?

Jason: It has a high quality camera and video camera, and it’s a videophone. It has a great GPS program, too. The touch-screen and the keyboard are easy to use and everything is so intuitive. Even a child could use it.

Hitomi: Yeah, but a child couldn’t afford the expensive price tag, right?

Jason: True enough, but it has a removable SIM card and is Bluetooth compatible. I can even use it as an e-book reader, and download apps for just about anything I want to do. No child’s toy could do all of those things.

Hitomi: Yes, that’s true, but I have just one question.

Jason: What?

Hitomi: Can you make a telephone call on it?

Jason: A telephone call? You mean a regular phone call? Yes, I think so.

### 0648 Working on Commission

Dennis: I just got a new sales job and I’m going to be making a bundle.

Irene: What kind of job is it?

Dennis: I’ll be working strictly on commission. The more I sell, the more I earn. It’s a great opportunity for someone with my talents in sales.

Irene: I know you’re great at sales and I’m sure you’ll do well, but you can’t coast in a job based on commissions. You’ll have to work really, really hard.

Dennis: I’m not worried. For me, selling is second nature. I’ll barely have to lift a finger and the profits will come rolling in.

Irene: But isn’t your paycheck going to be in flux all the time? You’ll never know what your take-home pay will be.

Dennis: There’s no cap on how much I can earn, so the sky’s the limit.

Irene: That’s not exactly what I meant. Some weeks, it may be hard to live on what you earn, don’t you think?

Dennis: What? Do I hear a hint of uncertainty in your voice?

Irene: No, it’s just that…

Dennis: Put your mind at ease. I could sell ice to Alaskans!

### 0649 Disliking a Sibling’s Boyfriend or Girlfriend

Georgia: So I thought Carla was nice.

Andy: You did? I didn’t get that impression at all. I don’t know what Brian sees in her.

Georgia: Really? I thought she was really trying to make a good impression.

Andy: Yeah, she was trying too hard. She laughed too loudly at my jokes and complimented you too much on your cooking.

Georgia: Maybe she was a little too eager, but that just shows that she really likes our brother. What’s wrong with that?

Andy: Nothing is wrong with that, but did you see how clingy she was? She wouldn’t leave Brian’s side for a minute, spoke for him, and finished his sentences. I just found that really annoying.

Georgia: Brian didn’t seem to mind and that’s what really counts. Maybe he likes having an attentive girlfriend.

Andy: There’s attentive and there’s smothering. She just seemed really possessive, that’s all.

Georgia: Methinks the gentleman doth protest too much.

Andy: What do you mean by that?

Georgia: I think you might like Carla a little too much for your own good. Shame on you, being interested in your own brother’s girlfriend.

Andy: Are you crazy?! Didn’t I just tell you that I didn’t like her at all?

Georgia: Yes, but you said it with such passion!

### 0650 Buying Television and Movie Programs

Cameron: What did you get for Christmas?

James: I got a box set of my favorite TV show of all time, the McQ Files. It contains all five seasons of the show, deleted scenes, and outtakes. I can’t wait to watch it all!

Cameron: Didn’t you see the entire series when it was shown on TV?

James: I did, but the bonus features make it a must-have for a big fan like me.

Cameron: I just don’t see why people spend good money buying shows they’ve already seen.

James: Hey, wait a second. Didn’t you run out and buy the Podinator trilogy box set when it went on sale last month?

Cameron: Uh, yeah, but that’s different. Those are movies, not TV shows. The Podinator box set had the director’s cut and commentary, not to mention never-before-released scenes.

James: Hadn’t you seen all three movies when they were shown in the theaters?

Cameron: Yes, but…

James: And don’t you own all three movies on video already?

Cameron: Well, maybe I do but…

James: Then I don’t see why you needed to buy the box set. I think it’s best that you give it to me.

Cameron: Touché.

### 0651 Psychological Disorders

Brett: Hi, Dr. Mollie. Could I speak to you for a few minutes?

Dr. Mollie: Certainly. Have a seat.

Brett: I’m really enjoying your psychology class and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.

Dr. Mollie: Sure, go ahead.

Brett: Well, I have a friend who is nervous all the time, especially around other people. Could he have a serious problem?

Dr. Mollie: It’s hard to say without knowing your friend, but he may have an anxiety disorder or some type of phobia.

Brett: I was afraid of that. Well, I have another friend who has mood swings all the time and washes his hands 50 times a day.

Dr. Mollie: Again, I don’t know your friend so it’s hard to make a diagnosis, but he may have a bipolar disorder and may also be obsessive-compulsive.

Brett: That sounds really serious. Well, I have another friend who doesn’t eat and sits around all day playing with fire. That’s bad, isn’t it?

Dr. Mollie: It could be. Your friend may have an eating disorder and his interest in fire may indicate that he has pyromania, but it’s very hard to say.

Brett: Did I mention that he likes to steal things, too?

Dr. Mollie: People who feel compelled to steal may have kleptomania. Who are all of these friends you’re talking about? Do I know them?

Brett: No, definitely not.

Dr. Mollie: Hmm, would your “friends” like to make an appointment with a therapist? It sounds like it may be a good idea.

Brett: No, no. My “friends” wouldn’t like that. He has a real fear of doctors.

### 0652 Outdoor Advertising

Kam: Okay, the purpose of our meeting today is to listen to some ideas for our new advertising campaign. Gina, take it away.

Gina: Thanks, Kam. I’m going to talk today about outdoor advertising. I know that it’s a new area for us and it hasn’t been on our radar in the past, but I know it’ll work well for our new campaign.

Kam: Can we talk specifics?

Gina: Sure. There are several types of outdoor advertising. One is the billboard, both the traditional kind and the digital ones. Advertising on ones in high-traffic areas will give us a lot of exposure. To get even more exposure all over town, we can use mobile advertising.

Kam: You mean advertise on buses?

Gina: Yes, more and more, products are being advertised on buses and cars. These wraps can also be put on the side of buildings and other structures. There really are a lot of outdoor advertising options, from bench ads to skywriting.

Kam: That’s all very interesting, but which of these methods do you recommend?

Gina: I think we should use all of them – blanket the city with our new ads.

Kam: All of them?

Gina: Yes, all of them. You know what they say: “Go big or go home.”

### 0653 Reading Product Reviews

Dominic: Do you want some help with that box?

Andrea: Sure, thanks.

Dominic: What is it?

Andrea: It’s a new TV. My old one has been on the fritz for a week and I needed a new one.

Dominic: Is this a highly-rated model?

Andrea: Highly-rated? I just went to the electronics store and bought it. It was on sale.

Dominic: You mean you didn’t read up on it before you bought it? You didn’t look at the reviews?

Andrea: No, I never do that. I think that’s a waste of time. I go with my gut.

Dominic: But if you read the reviews, you’ll know which product gives you the best value, which is the most reliable and durable, and which company has good customer support. Nobody wants to buy something that’s defective or poorly designed. Don’t you care about those things?

Andrea: Maybe, but who has time to do that? Instead, I go to the store and see which one I like overall. If it’s on sale, that’s all the better. That’s worked for me so far.

Dominic: Is that how you bought your old TV?

Andrea: Yeah.

Dominic: Enough said.

### 0654 Talking About Sound and Volume

Delilah: Could you turn that down?

Josh: What?

Delilah: Could you turn your music down?

Josh: Oh, sure. Is there a problem?

Delilah: No, there’s no problem. I was just trying to do some reading and the ear-splitting music coming from your room made it hard to concentrate.

Josh: Sorry. I didn’t think it was that loud. I didn’t turn it up, I swear. The volume control is in the same place it always is, not one decibel higher.

Delilah: That may be true, but those high-pitched squeals coming out of your speakers are really grating. And what was that banging sound?

Josh: Oh, I was just using this hammer to fix my chair. I’m done.

Delilah: And what was that thumping noise?

Josh: Thumping noise? Oh, I was lifting weights and dropping them back down on the floor.

Delilah: I see. If you could please keep the volume to a moderate level, I would appreciate it.

Josh: No problem. I’ll be as quiet as a mouse – as I always am.

### 0655 Staying in a Vacation Rental

George: I’m kind of nervous staying in a vacation rental for the first time.

Marnie: Don’t worry. Before I booked this unit, I checked it out thoroughly. It’s pet-friendly and kid-friendly, and it sleeps six, so it’ll be perfect for the whole family.

George: But there won’t be the same amenities or services as a hotel.

Marnie: We won’t need any of those. Just think, we’ll have the run of the place and there are no adjoining units. The proximity to town is great and I got a last-minute price that’s even lower than their low season rate.

George: Everything sounds good, but…

Marnie: It’ll be our home away from home. Units this close to the beach are scarce, and this one is really affordable.

George: A little too affordable, if you ask me. You said that it’s just $60 a night?

Marnie: That’s right.

George: Are there any taxes or cleaning fees?

Marnie: I didn’t ask about that.

George: Do they require a refundable deposit?

Marnie: I didn’t check that either.

George: Then maybe it’s too good to be true. Before we get too excited, let’s go read the fine print.

### 0656 Ordering Business Stationery

Jermaine: How did the investor meeting go?

Teresa: That meeting has been postponed until next week. One of the potential investors is out of town.

Jermaine: In that case, can you help me with some of this work?

Teresa: I would, but I’m busy ordering stationery right now.

Jermaine: Stationery? You’re ordering stationery?

Teresa: Yes, of course. For us to be taken seriously as a new company, we have to project a professional image. Having good stationery is part of that.

Jermaine: I’m not sure…

Teresa: Look, we can’t go to business meetings without good business cards, right?

Jermaine: I guess so…

Teresa: If we have any correspondence with our potential investors, we need letterhead and envelopes, right?

Jermaine: I suppose…

Teresa: Okay, so I’m ordering those things. In the process, I’m ordering some embossed greeting cards and some promotional postcards. We’ll also need some notepads and…

Jermaine: Whoa! Aren’t you jumping the gun?

Teresa: Why do you say that?

Jermaine: First, we need to establish a company, and then we can start behaving like one.

Teresa: That’s where you’re wrong. If you build it, they will come.

Jermaine: You mean if we start behaving like a company, then the investors will come?

Teresa: Precisely!

### 0657 Checking Accounts and Writing Checks

Marianne: I don’t understand it. I got a notice from the bank that two of my checks bounced. I’ve never had an overdraft in my life.

Jae: That doesn’t sound like you. You’re always so careful with your money.

Marianne: I am! I don’t understand what happened.

Jae: Let me take a look at your bank statement. Okay, here are your deposits and withdrawals from last month. Did you know that your bank charges you a fee just to have a checking account?

Marianne: It does? I didn’t know that.

Jae: It looks like you also have a minimum balance requirement. If you fall below that, you get charged a fee.

Marianne: I do?

Jae: If it’s like my checking account, you can avoid that by getting direct deposit for your paycheck. Did you also know that you get charged every time you use your ATM card to make a purchase?

Marianne: I didn’t know that!

Jae: Well, that’s what happened. Your bank is charging you fees for all of those things and after those fees were deducted, you were left with less money in your account than you thought.

Marianne: That’s so sneaky! How could they do that?

Jae: They count on you not reading the terms and conditions and not looking closely at your statements.

Marianne: I’ve had it! I’m moving banks. I’m taking my business elsewhere.

Jae: Oh, yeah? I know of a good bank.

Marianne: You do?

Jae: Sure, it’s called the Bank of Jae. No fees – ever.

Marianne: Yes, but would I ever see my money again?

### 0658 Judging a Contest

Adelia: When I created this writing contest, I had no idea that we would get so many entries.

Omar: Good thing you have an impartial panel of judges to help you select the winner.

Adelia: Yes, good thing. I’m really grateful to all of you for giving up your time to help.

Omar: What criteria are we using to score each of the entries?

Adelia: We’re using a 10-point scale. Each of us will read an entry and give it a score. When we’re all done, we’ll average out those scores. Hopefully, there’ll be a clear winner.

Omar: And if not?

Adelia: If there isn’t, then we’ll take the top scorers and vote on which is best. Majority rules.

Omar: Okay, but are there reasons for disqualifying an entry? For instance, what if somebody didn’t follow the entry guidelines?

Adelia: I’ve already culled the entries for the ones that don’t meet the requirements. These are all eligible.

Omar: Okay, let’s get started. We’ve got our work cut out for us.

Adelia: You’ve got that right.

### 0659 Finding Love on Valentine’s Day

Tony: Another Valentine’s Day! I really hate Valentine’s Day.

Chelsea: What’s your problem?

Tony: I’m sick of seeing heart-shaped boxes, stuffed animals, and cupid decorations everywhere. Lovey-dovey couples on the street and nothing but sentimental movies on TV – that’s what I have a problem with.

Chelsea: You’re just jaded because you don’t have a valentine on Valentine’s Day.

Tony: Do you blame me? This is the third year I’m spending Valentine’s Day alone. That’s enough to make any man feel jaded.

Chelsea: There are plenty of women you could go out with. Just open your eyes and look around.

Tony: All of the women I know are either psycho or attached. I’ve given up on dating.

Chelsea: How will you find a Miss Right with an attitude like that?

Tony: I’ve told you. I’ve given up.

Chelsea: Well, I think you should open your eyes. Your valentine may be right under your nose!

### 0660 Work-Related Injuries

Darrelle: I just went to a seminar about work-related injuries. I really have to rethink my workspace.

Kim: Work-related injuries? It’s not like we’re doing heavy lifting every day. We sit at our desks all day.

Darrelle: That’s the problem. Look at how you’re slouching over your keyboard. Poor posture can cause a lot of problems over time. Aren’t you always complaining about back pain?

Kim: Yeah, but…

Darrelle: And look at how you squint at your computer monitor all day. Aren’t you always complaining about headaches? You’re probably suffering from eye strain.

Kim: It’s true that I sometimes have headaches.

Darrelle: It’s no wonder. Look at what we do all day, repetitive motion after repetitive motion. Aren’t you suffering from elbow pain right now?

Kim: I was this morning…

Darrelle: See what I mean? We need better ergonomics in this office.

Kim: Okay, where do we start?

Darrelle: I think we need to sign up for a seminar on how to prevent work-related injuries.

Kim: What do you have in mind?

Darrelle: How about this four-day seminar?

Kim: But that seminar is in Florida.

Darrelle: What better way to recover from any work-related injuries than spending four days and three nights in Florida?

Kim: Count me in!

### 0661 Demanding an Apology

Vera: That was uncalled for. You owe me an apology!

Alvaro: Chill out. It was a joke!

Vera: It wasn’t funny and it crossed the line.

Alvaro: Why are you freaking out? Get over it. I was just joking.

Vera: You really hurt my feelings.

Alvaro: For God’s sake, I didn’t mean it. I take it back, okay?

Vera: You do?

Alvaro: Yes, I do.

Vera: And you’re sorry? You really regret what you said?

Alvaro: I’m sorry you heard my joke.

Vera: That’s not a real apology. You owe me a real apology. What you said was cruel.

Alvaro: I made a joke about you being over the hill. You’re clearly not over the hill, so it was clearly a joke. Okay?

Vera: Do you really think I’m old?

Alvaro: No, I don’t. But you know what you’re doing to me right now? You’re taking years off my life!

### 0662 Doctor-Patient Confidentiality

Dr. Green: Can I consult you on a case of medical ethics?

Dr. Hause: Sure, I’m not a lawyer, but I can give you my opinion as another doctor.

Dr. Green: That’s what I’m looking for, your honest opinion. I have a patient who has a medical condition that can be spread to her family, but she doesn’t want to tell them about it. I don’t want to breach doctor-patient confidentiality, but I think that at least her husband should know.

Dr. Hause: That’s a tricky one. We both know that the only way we can get our patients to divulge any sensitive information is if they trust us. We can’t easily put aside that confidentiality.

Dr. Green: I know, but if she doesn’t tell her family, then they are in danger of developing serious medical problems themselves. I took the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. How can I keep her secret and adhere to the spirit of that oath?

Dr. Hause: I see what you mean. If I were you, I’d sit my patient down and tell her what you think her responsibilities are to her family. Maybe you can convince her to tell them.

Dr. Green: I’ve tried talking to her already, and she didn’t want to listen. I’ll try again. But what if she doesn’t agree?

Dr. Hause: Then you can either drop it, tell her family, or…

Dr. Green: Or what?

Dr. Hause: Hope your patient has a miraculous recovery.

### 0663 Having Problems Concentrating

Vagner: Aren’t you supposed to be studying for the driver’s test?

Liesl: I’m supposed to be, but I keep getting distracted. Reading this manual is deadly.

Vagner: I know, but if you don’t study, you’ll never pass the test. Try to focus.

Liesl: I’ve tried to keep my mind on the rules of the road, but I’m having trouble concentrating. My mind keeps wandering and I’m almost ready to throw in the towel for today.

Vagner: No, you can’t do that. You have to buckle down and learn what’s in this manual. I’m here to crack the whip.

Liesl: What’s in it for you? What do you care if I pass the driver’s test or not?

Vagner: You can ask me that? I’ve been chauffeuring you around since I got my driver’s license and I don’t plan on doing it for one second more than I have to.

Liesl: All right, all right, I’ll study, but not because you’re telling me to.

Vagner: Oh, yeah? Then why?

Liesl: I want to see the look on your face the first time Dad gives me the car keys instead of you!

### 0664 Preparing a Video Resume

Katrina: Okay, I’m ready to hear all of your advice about what to put into a video resume.

Raj: All right. The first thing to remember is that your video resume doesn’t take the place of your traditional resume; it supplements it.

Katrina: Okay, I got it. I was thinking of talking about some of my outside interests and activities to show that I’m a well-rounded person.

Raj: I’d forget about that, if I were you. The point of the video resume is to make a good business impression. It’s not about showing your outside skills or interests. You’re marketing yourself as a business professional so you should wear business attire, something you would wear to an interview.

Katrina: Oh, so this outfit is out, I guess. I wanted to show them my personality.

Raj: I think that outfit would definitely knock you out of contention for any job. You have to get it out of your head that you’re going to get hired for your personality or charm. What counts are your qualifications, your skills, and how you handle yourself in a business setting.

Katrina: Oh, I was afraid you were going to say that.

Raj: Stop selling yourself short. Your qualifications and skills are as good as the next guy’s. You just have to believe in yourself.

Katrina: Right, I have to believe in myself…I have to believe in myself. Hey, I think I can do it!

Raj: Really? You think you can produce a video resume that’s professional and polished?

Katrina: Sure, it should be no problem. I know just the right person to hire as a stand-in!

### 0665 Types of Sandwiches

Geraldo: I am so hungry. When can we go eat?

Natasha: Just another minute and I’ll be finished here. What do you have a craving for?

Geraldo: I want a good sandwich, maybe a BLT or a pastrami on rye. Now that I think of it, a Reuben or a club sandwich would really hit the spot. I wonder if Nathan’s is still open.

Natasha: I doubt it. It’s really late.

Geraldo: In that case, maybe we can find a diner where I can get a French dip or a cheesesteak sandwich. I’d even settle for a tuna or chicken salad sandwich.

Natasha: The nearest diner is closed for renovations, remember?

Geraldo: What are we going to do?

Natasha: I know of a place that’s open and ready to serve.

Geraldo: Where?

Natasha: My place.

Geraldo: You can make me a good sandwich?

Natasha: You’ll have a choice of grilled cheese or peanut butter and jelly. What do you say?

Geraldo: I guess beggars can’t be choosers.

### 0666 Traveling to Less Popular Sites

Vanessa: Put away that guidebook. I want our vacation to be exciting and unique, not cookie cutter. Tourists all visit the same sites. I want to explore and go to some places off the beaten path.

Justin: That would be fine except we’ve never traveled to Podville before and we don’t speak the language. How are we going to make our way around if we don’t plan out our trip?

Vanessa: We’ll be fine. Stop worrying. We spend too much time planning. Let’s just fly by the seat of our pants.

Justin: You really want to just go unprepared? That’s just not sensible. Anything could happen.

Vanessa: I’m not going to lose sleep over it. We just need to meet some locals and they’ll be able to tell us about the hidden, secluded, and offbeat sites. Those are the ones I want to see.

Justin: You can explore all you like, but I’m bringing some insurance.

Vanessa: What insurance?

Justin: I’m bringing two guidebooks and this phone number.

Vanessa: Phone number for what?

Justin: The phone number for the American embassy. That’s where I plan to go for help when you get lost off the beaten path!

### 0667 Trying to Remember

Randal: Hurry up. Rob will be here any minute.

Marjorie: I can’t remember the combination to this lock.

Randal: I thought you knew it by heart.

Marjorie: It’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t seem to remember the last two digits. It’s 73 or 63 or 38…

Randal: You said you had it down cold!

Marjorie: I do know it, but it’s just slipped my mind. I’ll figure it out. I used a mnemonic to remember those last two digits. I just need to jog my memory. The last digits have to do with my birthday, or is it Rob’s birthday…

Randal: I only let you in on this little joke we’re going to play on Rob because you said you knew the combination to the lock on his bike. I should have known you were lying through your teeth.

Marjorie: I wasn’t lying. I really do know it. If you’ll just stop talking so I can concentrate…

Randal: Too late. Here comes Rob. Run for your life, if you know what’s good for you!

### 0668 Having Cash Flow Problems

Kylie: I’ve just crunched the numbers and we’re not going to be able to meet payroll next month because of cash flow problems.

Miguel: That can’t be. The cash flow projections from last month showed that we’d be fine.

Kylie: We didn’t anticipate a shortfall in income this month and didn’t set aside enough cash to hedge against a cash flow problem.

Miguel: What can we do? We need a stopgap solution now.

Kylie: Well, we could try to extend our line of credit at the bank.

Miguel: We’re already overextended at the bank. I don’t want to push our luck.

Kylie: The other option is to hold off on paying our suppliers and hope that our income goes up next month, as predicted.

Miguel: Do you really think we can hold them off for that long?

Kylie: I’ll have a talk with our biggest suppliers and give them assurances that they’ll get paid. Let’s just hope they’re not having cash flow problems of their own!

### 0669 Making Controversial Comments

Vivian: That news commentator should be fired for making such inflammatory comments. At least I won’t watch this show again until she is.

William: As usual, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. She was just expressing her opinion, albeit a controversial one.

Vivian: Her opinion is offensive. Mark my words: Before the end of the week, a lot of people will be up in arms calling for her head on a platter.

William: I doubt it. It’ll all blow over. It’s just a tempest in a teapot.

Vivian: No way. She’ll never get away with it.

William: Oh, yeah?

Vivian: Yeah.

William: Do you want to make a bet?

Vivian: Sure, I’ll take that bet. What does the winner get?

William: Just the pleasure of seeing the other person eat her words.

### 0670 To Forgive and Forget

Luc: You’ll never guess who called and left a voicemail message today.

Angela: Who?

Luc: Barbara!

Angela: Oh, really? What did she want?

Luc: She said she was calling to RSVP for our party this Saturday.

Angela: Did she?

Luc: Stop playing innocent with me. Did you or did you not invite her to our party this Saturday?

Angela: I may have. Okay, I did.

Luc: Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t you and Barbara have a knock-down, drag-out fight last month?

Angela: We may have.

Luc: And didn’t you say that you’d never speak to her again much less invite her over to our house?

Angela: That’s water under the bridge. You know what they say: “To err is human, to forgive divine.”

Luc: I can’t believe my ears. You ranted and raved for days that you’d hold against her for the rest of your life all of the terrible things she said about you.

Angela: I was being overdramatic. I don’t think I ranted and raved, actually. We just had a little spat. It’s best just to forgive and forget.

Luc: Unbelievable! Why can’t you have a selective memory when we have fights?

### 0671 Vacationing on an Island

Mohsen: I need to get off this island. I’m getting island fever.

Ella: We’ve only been here two days. Give it a chance. We’re here to enjoy a slower pace of life, remember?

Mohsen: When you said we were going on an island vacation, I didn’t know we’d be so isolated. There isn’t a living soul within five miles!

Ella: This isn’t isolated; it’s secluded. We have privacy and serenity. Isn’t that what we wanted?

Mohsen: I wanted a vacation with all of the creature comforts.

Ella: That’s what we have, don’t you think? We’re staying in a very nice house.

Mohsen: Yes, but what about the creature comforts? I have no Internet access and no cell phone service. This is what I call roughing it.

Ella: We agreed that we both needed a little time away to unwind. The whole point of this vacation is for us to relax.

Mohsen: I’m cut off from civilization and I have no access to email and my favorite websites. What could be more stressful than this?!

### 0672 Asking for More Time

Dan: Hello.

Marcia: Hi, Dan. What’s the status on the project? We’re still on schedule, right?

Dan: Uh, well, I’ve been meaning to call you about that. We’ve had a slight delay.

Marcia: What do you mean by “slight”? Are you saying that you won’t be able to meet the deadline?

Dan: Not exactly. I’m only asking that you grant us a short extension.

Marcia: How short?

Dan: A week or two, tops. We hit a minor snag, but we should have everything up and running in no time.

Marcia: If the project has come to a grinding halt, then it doesn’t sound like a minor snag. We’re running on a tight schedule and we don’t have a lot of time to spare.

Dan: I know that all too well.

Marcia: Good, then I don’t have to spell it out for you.

Dan: No, you don’t. My head is on the chopping block and the clock is ticking.

### 0673 Walking or Running as Exercise

Reina: Okay, I’m ready to walk my way to better fitness!

Lars: I’m glad you’re so enthusiastic about starting to exercise.

Reina: I’m totally psyched! Check out my new tennis shoes.

Lars: They’re brand new? You haven’t broken them in yet? I hope you don’t get blisters.

Reina: Stop worrying. Let’s go, I’m ready to work up a sweat!

Lars: Wait. There are a few things you need to know before we start. It’s a good idea to stretch and to warm up to avoid injuries.

Reina: I stretched already and as soon as we get started, I’ll warm up slowly. Let’s go!

Lars: All right, here we go, nice and slow.

Reina: Come on! How are we supposed to increase our heart rate if we walk this slowly? Pick up the pace!

Lars: I don’t want to get shin splints. It’s important that we start slowly and maintain a low-impact workout.

Reina: Forget it! I’ll race you. The last one to the park buys lunch. Ready, set, go!

Lars: Wait!

### 0674 Threatening Other Countries

Tania: Did you see the news today? Canada has been doing military exercises near the Canada-U.S. border. I think they’re trying to send us a message.

Emilio: They’re just saber-rattling. They think we’re amassing weapons near the border and they’re posturing.

Tania: I don’t think they’re just posturing.

Emilio: Canada is no real threat. No one in the government wants to bear the responsibility of violating Canada’s treaty with us.

Tania: How can you say that? All of this military aggression makes me nervous. If Canada decides to attack, we would have no choice but to retaliate. Things could escalate very quickly.

Emilio: That’s why I’m well prepared.

Tania: Well prepared? How?

Emilio: Haven’t you seen me building my underground bunker? I’ll be safe there if Canada, or anyone else, strikes.

Tania: An underground bunker?

Emilio: Yes, and if you ask nicely, I’ll save a place for you.

### 0675 Having Furniture Delivered

I was waiting patiently for the furniture store to deliver my new bed. I was given a window of 1:00 to 4:00. At 4:50, the delivery truck pulled up in front of my house.

……

Zuly: Hello.

Danny: Hi! We’re from Reliable Furniture. We’re here to deliver your new bed.

Zuly: I thought you’d never get here. The new bed should go in the bedroom. Follow me. You’ll haul away the old bed, right?

Danny: We will for an extra charge.

Zuly: I thought that was included in the price of the new bed.

Danny: Let me check the paperwork. Oh, I guess it is. We’ll take away the old bed and bring in the new one.

Zuly: Okay, this way. You can bring the bed right in here.

Danny: Okay, here you are. We’re all done.

Zuly: Aren’t you guys going to remove the bubble wrap, assemble the pieces, and set up the bed?

Danny: We can, but it’ll cost extra.

Zuly: I’m sure that’s included in the price of the new bed.

Danny: Let me check…Okay, I guess we’ll set it up. We’re just running a little late, that’s all. We got a late start from the warehouse this morning and it’s already past quitting time.

……

I wasn’t too happy, to say the least, but I was at their mercy and didn’t say anything. But as soon as they’re finished, I’ll be ready to give them a piece of my mind!

### 0676 Selecting a Health Insurance Plan

Mikhail: What’s all this?

Carol: It’s open enrollment at my company and I’m thinking of switching health plans. I have an HMO right now and I’m thinking of switching to a PPO. That way, I can see doctors outside of my current network and still be covered.

Mikhail: I’m so glad I don’t have to worry about things like that. I’m still a dependent on my mother’s plan, at least for another year.

Carol: Lucky you. Look at all of this literature! How am I supposed to make heads or tails of this to compare one plan with another?

Mikhail: Wow, yeah, that’s really confusing.

Carol: Tell me about it. I want to know if these new plans have coverage for my pre-existing conditions and prescription drugs, and if not, what the out-of-pocket costs would be.

Mikhail: Don’t look at me.

Carol: And how am I supposed to figure out what my copay and deductible would be?

Mikhail: You’re on your own on this one. It’s all Greek to me!

### 0677 Feeding a Picky Eater

Jeremy: It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me tonight.

Keeley: I’m glad to do it. You’re been so helpful to me, it’s only fair that I return the favor. I hope you’ve brought your appetite.

Jeremy: You bet.

Keeley: Great! Here’s the first course, a light soup. How do you like it?

Jeremy: It has an interesting flavor.

Keeley: You don’t care for it.

Jeremy: It’s just a little greasy for my taste.

Keeley: Sorry about that. Why don’t you try this dish? It’s an old family recipe. What’s wrong?

Jeremy: Oh, nothing. I just don’t think it’s agreeing with me. Maybe it’s an acquired taste.

Keeley: Okay, maybe I can whip up something else for you…

Jeremy: I don’t want to put you to all that trouble. Sorry to be so fussy.

Keeley: No, no trouble at all.

…

I like cooking, but with such a picky eater like Jeremy, I might be cooking into next Tuesday!

### 0678 Reporting Damaged Luggage

I picked up my luggage off of the baggage carousel and noticed that the handle was broken and some of my clothes were falling out of the open zipper. The bag looked like it had been mishandled, but could someone have tampered with it, too? I went to the baggage claim office to report what I found.

Clerk: Next. How can I help you?

Jordan: I retrieved my bag and found that it’s been damaged.

Clerk: What’s the problem?

Jordan: The handle is broken and I think someone has gone through my bag.

Clerk: That was probably security. They may have searched your luggage.

Jordan: Yes, but my camera is missing and everything is in disarray. I’m not sure if other things are missing.

Clerk: Why don’t you make a more thorough inspection over there and then you can file a claim for anything that’s missing or broken.

Jordan: Will I be compensated for the damage to my luggage and for my missing camera?

Clerk: I really can’t say.

Jordan: How long will it take for someone to contact me?

Clerk: I really can’t say. Next!

…

I knew a blow off when I heard it, but I looked through my bag anyway and filled out the forms. Who knows? Miracles do happen, don’t they?

### 0679 Getting a Makeover

Kurt: Come with me.

Ellie: Where are you taking me?

Kurt: I’m giving you a makeover and you have no say about it.

Ellie: A makeover?! I don’t need a makeover.

Kurt: Yes, you do. I’m your best friend and this is an intervention. You’re so busy these days that you’ve let yourself go.

Ellie: I haven’t let myself go. I just don’t spend as much time as I used to primping and getting dolled up, that’s all.

Kurt: On that we agree. Your clothes are frumpy and your hairstyle is 10 years out-of-date. Come on. I’m taking you to get a new look. It’ll be a complete transformation.

Ellie: Okay, I admit that my appearance needs a little updating, but I’m not giving you free rein on what changes to make.

Kurt: I’m willing to let you have some say in that – if you come quietly.

Ellie: And if I don’t?

Kurt: You’re getting this makeover one way or another, even if I have to drag you kicking and screaming!

### 0680 Recognizing an Unsung Hero

Fumi: You may have everyone else fooled, but I know the real reason for the success of this project.

Issac: What?

Fumi: You. You’ve been working behind the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task. Without you, this project would have been sunk months ago.

Issac: That’s nonsense.

Fumi: No, it’s not. I know you don’t like the limelight, but you were the linchpin of this operation. Without you, we’d all have egg on our faces today.

Issac: You’re giving me way too much credit. I don’t want to hear another word about it.

Fumi: I’m not surprised at your reaction. Most unsung heroes like to keep a low profile.

Issac: What?! I’m nothing of the kind!

Fumi: Yes, you are. You’re far too modest. And soon, I won’t be the only one who thinks so!

Issac: What are you proposing to do?

Fumi: Don’t worry. I’m not planning a ticker-tape parade, but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are around here!

### 0681 Disagreeing about Religion

Jim: You know that religion is a taboo subject, especially with Paul. Why were you baiting him all through dinner?

Tammy: I wasn’t baiting him. We have very different views on spirituality and I wanted to discuss the subject with him.

Jim: You were making disparaging remarks about his faith and some of the things he holds most sacred. I think you were trying to be provocative.

Tammy: I may have said a few things that were provocative, but I don’t understand how people can believe in superstitions.

Jim: There you go again! People’s religious beliefs shouldn’t be called superstitions.

Tammy: I’m just calling it like I see it. I didn’t know you were such a fundamentalist.

Jim: I’m not a fundamentalist. In fact, I’m an atheist, or at least an agnostic, but I still try to show respect for other people’s beliefs.

Tammy: Beliefs are made to be challenged. If you can’t defend your beliefs, you shouldn’t have them.

Jim: Ladies and gentlemen, behold the voice of tolerance.

### 0682 Minor Medical Injuries

Cherise: Rise and shine! Isn’t it a lovely day? I love getting back to nature. There’s nothing like going camping. How did you sleep?

Evan: That was the most miserable night of my life!

Cherise: Really? What happened?

Evan: I woke up in the middle of the night and thought I heard a bear. I got up, stubbed my toe, and tripped. I have scratches all over my arms, not to mention these bruises on my legs. See?

Cherise: Oh, don’t you know that there aren’t any bears this late in the year?

Evan: How should I have known that? This was my first time camping.

Cherise: All right. Why are you holding your neck like that?

Evan: I couldn’t get comfortable at all sleeping on the ground. I woke up with a crick in my neck.

Cherise: Stop moving around like that or you’ll really hurt yourself.

Evan: Oh, I have a cramp in my shoulder! It hurts!

Cherise: I told you not to twist around like that. Just let it work itself out.

Evan: All of this had to happen to me after getting a stitch in my side and a charley horse hiking five miles yesterday. I’ve had it! I’m going back to civilization.

Cherise: How are you getting there?

Evan: What do you mean? I’m walking.

Cherise: Without food or water? You’d better wait for me or you may end up bear bait after all!

### 0683 Using a Video-Sharing Website

Melissa: You’re looking at the next overnight sensation. I’m uploading my video right now, and by this time tomorrow, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s had over 100,000 views. It’s going to go viral.

Frank: You and your amateur videos. Who is going to watch something with such low production value?

Melissa: You’d be surprised. I have my own channel on YouGube, with over 5,000 subscribers.

Frank: Are you sure that’s not because your username is AngelinaJolie?

Melissa: No, it’s because people enjoy my videos, mark them as their favorites, and share them with their friends. Word of mouth – that’s why I’m so popular.

Frank: But what about the comments on your videos? How many of those are positive and how many are negative?

Melissa: I don’t read the comments. I assume they’re all positive, and my videos have never been flagged.

Frank: All right, so is this another video of you dancing with your cat?

Melissa: No, my cat and I are dancing and singing. That’s why we’re both going to be the next big thing.

Frank: Right, I’ll get in line right now to buy tickets to your upcoming Vegas show.

### 0684 Asking for Information About a Coworker

Amina: What’s the lowdown on the new guy?

Earl: Which new guy?

Amina: You know, the cute one. Fill me in. Is he single?

Earl: I don’t know. I have no idea.

Amina: You’re working with him side-by-side and you haven’t gleaned any personal information about him?

Earl: We talk about work. It’s not my job to pry into his personal life.

Amina: I need to get the scoop on Mr. Perfect and you’re my source.

Earl: You don’t know anything about him, so how do you know he’s perfect? Maybe when you get to know him, you’ll find out he’s a selfish, self-centered jerk.

Amina: Wait, catch me up on what’s going on here. Have other people asked you about him?

Earl: Yeah, maybe about a dozen of the women in this office. They’ve been bombarding me with questions.

Amina: Oh, sorry. I didn’t know.

Earl: Yeah, I’m not the guy’s social secretary. You women have to satisfy your own curiosity elsewhere.

Amina: Point taken, but do you know if he’s shown interest in any of the dozen women you’ve talked to?

Earl: Ugh!

### 0685 Getting Feedback on Writing

Xica: I just got my paper back from Professor Rodriguez and it’s all marked up.

Lucas: Let me see. It doesn’t look too bad. This is a draft, right? His note at the top says to make revisions before handing in a final version. He’s trying to help you get a better grade.

Xica: Maybe, but there’s nothing he likes about the essay. Look at all of those comments in the margins. He underlined the entire introduction and wrote “run-on sentence” next to it.

Lucas: That’s easy to fix, and it is a run-on sentence, you know.

Xica: And in the body, he wrote that I had no transitions and that my arguments weren’t well supported.

Lucas: Well, transitions are easy to put in and you just need to cite a few more sources – that’s all.

Xica: Yeah, but that’s not all. Next to the conclusion, he wrote that I didn’t properly summarize my main points. See what I mean? There’s nothing he likes about this essay.

Lucas: I think you should take the constructive criticism as it’s meant – to help you.

Xica: It’s easy for you to say. You’re done with college. It’s kind of demoralizing to get your paper back all marked up.

Lucas: True, but you forget that I have my own battle wounds – lots of them!

### 0686 Roles Within a Family

Larissa: I’m really nervous about meeting your family.

Vince: You don’t need to be. They’ll love you and you’ll fit right in.

Larissa: Okay, but I want to make sure I know everyone I’ll be meeting. Your Grandmother Celine is the matriarch of the family and your Uncle Nick is the black sheep of the family, is that right?

Vince: That’s right, but none of us let on that Uncle Nick is considered the prodigal son. He was really rebellious when he was young and left home when he was 17. He came back 15 years later, but nobody really knows what happened during that time. He’s always been a little eccentric.

Larissa: I’ll be sure to steer clear of Uncle Nick, in that case. Let’s see, you told me that he is the oldest and your Aunt Sue is the baby of the family. Where does your Aunt Lily come in?

Vince: She’s the middle child and is always the scapegoat for anything that goes wrong. At least that’s what my grandfather has told me all these years.

Larissa: That’s your Grandfather Albert, the patriarch of the family, right?

Vince: Yes, you’ve got it. I’m impressed you remembered so much about my family.

Larissa: If I’m walking into the lion’s den, then I want to be prepared.

Vince: Don’t think of it that way. They’re all going to love you.

Larissa: Famous last words!

### 0687 Shopping for a Television

Byung: This is what I’m talking about! It’s time to upgrade to a big-screen TV and this is the perfect place to buy one.

Nelly: They certainly have a large selection. These new TVs have pictures that are much sharper than our current one.

Byung: There’s no comparison. These new TVs have a much better resolution. Just look at the brightness and the contrast! Our old TV looks washed out by comparison.

Nelly: And listen to that sound quality. It’s like being in a movie theater with surround sound.

Byung: Yeah, it’s time we moved into the 21st century.

Nelly: According to what I’ve read, with a viewing distance of 10 feet, we should look for a screen size of about 40 inches.

Byung: I was thinking more like a 60-inch screen.

Nelly: A 60-inch TV?! That would take up the entire living room wall.

Byung: That’s exactly what I had in mind!

### 0688 Ending a Business Relationship

Jerry: Who’s going to break the news to Tech Experts?

Camila: You mean about pulling the plug on using their services?

Jerry: Yeah, the contract we signed with them last year is almost up, and as we decided last month, we’ll be going with another company.

Camila: I think we should hold off on telling them until after all of our current projects are done. We still have two more in the hopper.

Jerry: Okay, but I don’t want to drag our feet in telling them, even if we’re not happy with their service. As a professional courtesy, we should let them know soon.

Camila: That may be true with other companies, but Tech Experts has really let us down this past year. If we didn’t have an airtight contract with them, we would have switched companies long ago.

Jerry: Well, maybe they’ll learn from their mistakes. After all, they’ve been in business a long time.

Camila: Yeah, but old habits die hard. And if you ask me, the company is on its last legs. It’s only a matter of time before they lose most of their customers, at the rate they’re going.

Jerry: I don’t know about that, but I do know one thing. It’s a good thing you’re not their PR rep!

### 0689 Listening to a Political Speech

Kylie: Can you understand a word he’s saying?

Ramis: I doubt if anyone can. He’s talking out of both sides of his mouth. First he says he’s fighting for the little guy, and then he says he’s a champion for businesses.

Kylie: I thought he’d be different, but he’s just like any other politician.

Ramis: He looks sincere and he sounds sincere, but when you actually listen to what he says, it’s nothing but double-talk.

Kylie: You’ve got that right. I wouldn’t trust him any farther than I could throw him. Now what is he saying?

Ramis: He says that he can cut taxes and increase government services. Now how do you suppose he could pull that off?

Kylie: He can’t. These are just campaign promises. Once he gets into office, he’ll renege on every one of those promises.

Ramis: Year after year it’s the same thing – broken promises and the same old same old. Why do we put up with it?

Kylie: Why? I have an answer for you. Do you want to run for office?

Ramis: Me?! Are you kidding? Not on your life.

Kylie: Right. That’s how I feel. I’m willing to sit back and let somebody else do the job. I guess we’ve dug our own graves.

### 0690 Types of Views

Andrea: Help me decide on which type of hotel room to book.

George: I want the one with a bed.

Andrea: Very funny. We have a choice of different views, and each one is a different price. For instance, a room with a city view is 175 dollars a night and a panoramic view is 275 dollars a night.

George: 275 dollars a night?! That’s highway robbery!

Andrea: If you think that’s too steep, there are a few other options. We can get a courtyard room with no view for 120 dollars a night or a room with an obstructed or peek-a-boo ocean views for 130 dollars a night.

George: I don’t really care which type of room we get as long as we don’t end up with a room on the ground floor. I don’t like having people walking back and forth outside my window all night.

Andrea: Okay, I can request a room on an upper floor. You really don’t have a preference?

George: No, not really.

Andrea: There is a penthouse room for 400 dollars a night.

George: What?! For that price, I’d better get a view of the Eiffel Tower, the Parthenon, and the Great Wall of China!

### 0691 Dangerous Freeway Driving

I do a lot of driving in my job. You would think that driving several hours each way would get old really fast, but I have ways of making an interminable drive seem much more exciting.

I like to drive fast on the freeways. I usually pass all of the slower cars by staying in the passing lane. When there’s a slow-moving car in the passing lane, though, I tailgate it until the driver moves over to another lane. If the driver doesn’t move over, I weave back and forth from one lane to another until I get around it. What can I say? I just don’t like anyone to keep me from the open road.

Sometimes, I encounter another driver who likes to drive fast and we have a drag race. I know how to bird dog the other car until I see a way to speed up and overtake it. That’s why I almost always win.

As you can see, I know how to spice up a boring drive. I hope to see you soon – on the road.

### 0692 Recommending Someone for a Job

Harry: I’ve put in a good word for you with my boss. He said to stop by the store at 4:00 today and he’ll interview you for the job.

Judy: Okay, I think I can make it around 4:00.

Harry: Not around 4:00. You need to be there at 4:00 sharp, got that? I’m sticking my neck out for you by recommending you for this job, so don’t let me down.

Judy: All right, I’ll be there. It’s not like it’s my idea to get a job at your store. I didn’t ask you to put your reputation on the line. I don’t think that job is a good fit for me.

Harry: You can’t afford to be choosy. You need a job and you need it right now.

Judy: I’m not in a hurry. I want to find a job that really suits my talents.

Harry: I’m sick of you sleeping on my couch and mooching off me. By the time you find a job that suits your talents, I’ll be in a nursing home – or an insane asylum!

### 0693 Following a Dress Code

Tae: What are you doing? Why are you taking all of my clothes out of my suitcase? I just finished packing that.

Nicole: You’ve packed all of the wrong things. We’re going on a luxury cruise and all you’ve packed are shorts and t-shirts.

Tae: I’m going on vacation and I don’t have to dress to impress.

Nicole: You’ve never been on a cruise like this one, but I have, and there’s a dress code. You’ll need formal wear for some of the dinners.

Tae: I’m not wearing a suit and tie on vacation.

Nicole: No, not a suit and tie. There’ll be a dance the final night of the cruise that’s black tie, so you’ll need your tuxedo. I’m bringing a few cocktail dresses myself. Don’t worry. You can go semi-formal the rest of the evenings.

Tae: This is ridiculous. I have to wear business attire 300 days out of the year and you’re making me dress up when I finally go on a vacation.

Nicole: You don’t have to dress up the entire time. You can go California casual during the day. I’m just asking that you look presentable a few hours each day. Is that so hard?

Tae: I knew there was a catch when you booked this vacation. It’s less a vacation for me than a dress-up party for you!

### 0694 Going to the Emergency Room

Saturday, 9:35 p.m.

I arrive in the emergency room. I had been at a party earlier in the evening when I accidentally cut my finger. My finger wasn’t severed, but it did have a very deep cut and I thought I might need stitches. I check in at the admissions desk and I’m told to take a seat and wait.

Saturday, 10:40 p.m.

I’m still waiting to see a doctor. The waiting room is filled to capacity and I expect it to be a long night.

Saturday, 11:15 p.m.

Several ambulances pull up to the door and EMTs wheel in several people on stretchers. I hear that there had been a pileup on Freeway 215 and these were the victims. I can see a doctor performing triage and the most critical cases are taken into exam rooms and maybe directly into surgery.

Sunday, 1:25 p.m.

I decide to give up and go home. If I hadn’t bled to death by that time, I could probably wait until Monday to see my regular physician.

My evening in the emergency room wasn’t a total loss, though. I learned a valuable lesson: Never voluntarily go to the emergency room!

### 0695 Being Late for an Event

Eric: Let’s get a move on or we’ll be late – again!

Carmen: Hold your horses. I’m on the verge of being ready. Rome wasn’t built in a day, you know.

Eric: A day? I’d settle for a week. Why is it that every time we have someplace to be you’re always running late?

Carmen: That’s because I march to the beat of a different drummer. Life isn’t about watching the clock; it’s about living in the moment.

Eric: Okay, at this very moment, we’re late.

Carmen: Just give me a couple of minutes more and I’ll be ready. After all, none of our friends expect us to be punctual anymore. They all know better.

Eric: Yeah, and I should, too. From now on, I’ll start getting ready when you say you’re all set. Then I’ll just have minutes to wait – not hours!

### 0696 Investing Your Money

Karen: My company offers a 401(k) plan. Do you think I should have one?

Jimmy: Yes, definitely. I had a 401(k) account when I worked for McQ Corp, and when I started working on my own I converted it to an IRA.

Karen: I really don’t understand any of these investment options. I talked to an investment specialist at my bank, but I left her office just as confused as when I went in.

Jimmy: Look, you want to have a diversified portfolio of lower-risk and higher-risk investments. On the low-risk end, put money in bonds, CDs, or a money market account. You want to balance that out with some riskier investments that may bring a higher return, such as mutual funds and stocks.

Karen: Wow, all of that just went over my head. I don’t know a CD from a bond.

Jimmy: It’s really simple. Your choice ranges from a fixed return to a variable return, and the variable investments carry different levels of risk.

Karen: My head hurts. Are you sure I really need all of these investments?

Jimmy: Not all of them, but it would be smart to invest your money in something.

Karen: Not if I spend it all first, right?

Jimmy: Right. You know what they say: “A fool and his money are soon parted!”

### 0697 Eating a School Lunch

Chris: What are you doing? Let’s get into the hot lunch line.

Sybil: See this lunchbox? My mom made me brown-bag it today. She says that the lunches served at school aren’t nutritious enough.

Chris: That sucks. What did she make you?

Sybil: A salad.

Chris: Oh, gross. I really feel sorry for you. What else?

Sybil: Let me see. There are some carrot sticks, too.

Chris: Sucker! You should have thrown a fit. I wouldn’t have taken it lying down. Listen to me. You should ditch that lunch and buy lunch instead, like me.

Sybil: I can’t. I don’t have any lunch money. Do you want to trade some of yours for mine?

Chris: You’re dreaming. There’s no way I’m trading my pizza for your salad and carrot sticks.

Sybil: Not even if I do your math homework?

Chris: Math homework? Now you’ve got my attention.

Sybil: Only if you give me the entire slice of pizza.

Chris: You drive a hard bargain. How about this? I’ll split the pizza with you, if you’ll do my homework.

Sybil: You must really think I’m a sucker if you think I’d agree to that!

### 0698 Making Ethnically or Racially Offensive Remarks

Mike: Did you hear what Dan said? He called me a mick. What decade is he living in?

Patti: He’s just ignorant. I’m sure he wasn’t trying to be offensive.

Mike: Well, I take offense. And to add insult to injury, did you hear what else he said?

Patti: What?

Mike: He said that he was speaking on behalf of the Irish in the community when he said he liked the plan. How dare he speak for other people? It’s presumptuous.

Patti: He was trying to make a point and probably just got carried away. I agree that what he said could be insulting, but let’s give him the benefit of the doubt.

Mike: You can be magnanimous if you want to be, but I know an ethnic slur when I hear one.

Patti: It wasn’t an ethnic slur. It wasn’t the politically correct term, that’s all. He’s a little behind the times.

Mike: Behind the times?! He’d have to live to 150 to catch up to the present!

### 0699 Dealing With the Paparazzi

Fredo: I feel like a prisoner in my own home! I can’t step outside without the paparazzi snapping pictures of me. They stake out my house 24 hours a day.

Amanda: I suppose that’s the price of fame. You do have the most popular podcast in the world.

Fredo: But they’re such a pain in the neck! They don’t just take pictures. They chase me in my car and follow me into restrooms, trying to corner me. It’s an invasion of privacy.

Amanda: You’re right, but look on the bright side. The paparazzi give you plenty of exposure. They keep your name – and your face – in the spotlight.

Fredo: It would be fine if they just took a few candid shots while I’m at dinner or at the store, but they try to take photos when I’m out of town, trying to catch me doing something I shouldn’t.

Amanda: At least, that’s good news for your wife. She can call off that private detective she hired to follow you from city to city!

### 0700 Starting a New Workweek

Naomi: Wow, you look like you had a rough weekend. A little too much partying, huh?

Aaron: You said it. I’m planning to ease into the new workweek. I need time to chill and to recover. Could you take a meeting this morning with our new client?

Naomi: What will you do?

Aaron: I’ll be sitting here waiting for hump day. The weekend can’t come soon enough!

Naomi: It’s Monday and you’re already looking forward to next weekend?

Aaron: You got it.

Naomi: And you want to slack off, while I take on the lion’s share of your work. Is that what you’re saying?

Aaron: Just this once. I’ll return the favor the next time you have a rough weekend.

Naomi: What are you planning for next weekend?

Aaron: Why do you ask?

Naomi: I want to know how long I’ll have to wait for a chance to sit back and watch you work!

### 0701 Improving Your Looks

Leo: Where have you been?

Mai: I’ve been meeting with an agent. You know I’ve wanted to pursue a career in acting for a long time, but today I actually met with a real agent. She thinks I have potential.

Leo: Is she going to sign you?

Mai: She might. She suggested a few improvements that are going to make me more salable as an actress.

Leo: What did she suggest?

Mai: Well, she thought I should get some hair extensions to make my hair look longer and fuller.

Leo: There’s nothing wrong with your hair.

Mai: Well, she thought it could use some sprucing up. She also recommended getting my teeth capped. At the very least, she said I should have teeth whitening done.

Leo: Your teeth look nice and natural. There’s nothing wrong with them.

Mai: She also suggested getting a spray tan, so I’d look healthier.

Leo: You already look healthy. Is she crazy?

Mai: No, I think she’s giving me good constructive criticism. I want to make myself as salable as possible.

Leo: It sounds like she wants to stamp out all of your individuality and turn you into a clone of every other actress out there.

Mai: I was thinking of taking her advice. I want to be salable.

Leo: You’re a person, not a piece of meat. Salable, schmalable! Don’t you even think about it!

### 0702 Finding Other Singles

I was tired of being single. All of my friends had paired up and I was left hanging. Like everybody else these days, I tried using the Internet to find other singles, but I never had any luck. Cruising for my ideal woman among a bunch of lonely hearts is like looking for a needle in a haystack. I needed another strategy.

I finally hit on a brilliant idea. I would find places where single women naturally congregate and simply show up. It may turn out to be a wild goose chase, but I was willing to give it a shot.

That’s how I decided to take a jewelry-making class at the community center. I may not know much, but I do know that two things that naturally go together are women and jewelry.

I got to the class a few minutes late so I could make a grand entrance. But when I walked in, I got the shock of my life. The room was full of single women all right, but not one of them was under the age of 70!

They were definitely glad to see me. I even received a couple of invitations to dinner that day. But to be honest, that wasn’t the kind of dinner date I had been looking for!

### 0703 Attending an Auction

Diane: This is so exciting! I’ve never been to an auction before.

Martin: Sit down. It’s about to start. The auctioneer is on the podium with her gavel and she’s ready to start the bidding.

Diane: Are you bidding on the first lot?

Martin: No, the reserve is too high. See? The opening bid is over 10,000 dollars. I’m not surprised. Items of that quality don’t appear on the auction block very often.

Diane: What are those people doing on the phone?

Martin: They are bidding on behalf of people who can’t be here, the absentee bidders. Hey, stop waving that paddle around! The auctioneer is going to think that you’re placing a bid.

Diane: Oh, sorry. Listen, the price is up to 30,500 dollars. Going, going, gone! The auction house is going to make a nice commission on that one. This is so much fun!

Martin: Shhh! I’m going to bid on the next lot. Where is the paddle?

Diane: The paddle?

Martin: Yeah, the paddle. Where did you put it?

Diane: I had it just a minute ago.

Martin: Find it, or else I’m putting your head on the block.

Diane: The auction block?

Martin: No, the chopping block!

### 0704 Reselling Products for Profit

Jessie: Where are you going?

Masa: I’m going to stand in line to get one of the first iDopes. They go on sale this morning at 9 a.m.

Jessie: Why don’t you just wait a couple of days when there’ll be no line?

Masa: I’m sure they’re going to sell out, and plus, I’m going to buy an extra one so I can resell it.

Jessie: You’re going to resell it? Oh, you mean like scalping tickets.

Masa: You got it. I can put a markup on it and make a nice little profit.

Jessie: You mean you’re going to jack up the price.

Masa: I’m not gouging anybody. I’m just putting a little premium on a product that’s in demand.

Jessie: But what if they don’t sell out? Won’t you be stuck with an extra iDope?

Masa: I won’t have any problems unloading it. Trust me, this is a simple case of supply and demand. I’ve got the supply and there’s a big demand. Hey, where are you going?

Jessie: I’m going with you. You’re not the only one in this house who wants to earn a little extra dough.

Masa: I didn’t say you could go with me.

Jessie: Why can’t I?

Masa: Because then I’d be helping you to junk up the market. And that would be shooting myself in the foot.

### 0705 An Exclusive Guest List

Catherine: Do you have a draft of the guest list? We need to get the invitations out next week.

Ralph: It’s not quite done yet. I keep going back and forth about a few people I’m not sure about, like Lacy Say.

Catherine: Lacy Say? She’s a has-been. She hasn’t been in a movie for years. We only want people on the A-list at this party.

Ralph: What about Jess McGillan? I’m on the fence about him.

Catherine: He’s definitely a D-lister. This party is very exclusive and we don’t want any D-listers rubbing elbows with VIPs.

Ralph: I understand that, but what if we don’t get enough A-listers to come?

Catherine: That will not happen. This party has to be a success!

Ralph: And if we don’t have enough guests because we’ve excluded so many D-list celebrities?

Catherine: There will always be gatecrashers. We can let in a few to buff up the numbers, if push comes to shove.

Ralph: What happens to the exclusivity of the party if that happens?

Catherine: If that happens, this party has bombed and I don’t care if we even let in podcasters!

### 0706 Feeling Ill from Food While Traveling

Rumi: I’m as sick as a dog!

Hugo: It serves you right. I warned you not to eat food sold by food vendors on the street. Cleanliness is not a priority at some of those food stands.

Rumi: I’m not one to turn up my nose up at street food. On the street is where you’ll find the most authentic food, the food the locals eat. And plus, I have a stomach of steel.

Hugo: You had a stomach of steel, and there’s no way to guard against undercooked or contaminated food.

Rumi: Okay, you’re right.

Hugo: It’ll probably take days for whatever it is that’s making you sick to work itself out of your system. Some vacation!

Rumi: Just be grateful you’re not puking your guts out like I am.

Hugo: Believe me, I’m thanking my lucky stars.

### 0707 Looking Back on One’s Life

Nick: I’m turning 40 this year and what do I have to show for it?

Danielle: Actually, you’ve accomplished a lot. Do you know what your problem is? Your expectations are too high and your goals are unattainable for most people.

Nick: Not for me. They shouldn’t have been. I had my life all planned out and nothing is turning out the way it should.

Danielle: I would never have pegged you for someone with regrets about how his life has turned out.

Nick: But I was supposed to make my first million dollars by the time I was 30. By 35, I should have met someone and settled down, maybe had a child or two. None of that has panned out.

Danielle: You have lots of friends and a full life. Maybe things didn’t turn out the way you had imagined, but wouldn’t you say you were generally content?

Nick: I was before I started thinking about my upcoming birthday.

Danielle: Then stop thinking about it. Too much brooding could definitely lead to regrets – not to mention premature aging!

### 0708 Trademarks and Logos

Bianca: Look at this logo I designed for our new line of products.

Vien: That’s really nice, but it looks a lot like our competitor’s logo. In fact, it’s almost identical.

Bianca: No, it’s not. The color is a different shade of green, the graphic is smaller, and instead of a picture of a woman, I’m using a picture of a man. They’re nothing alike.

Vien: That’s not what most people would say. Looking at your logo and our competitor’s logo side by side, I’d say this was a clear case of trademark infringement.

Bianca: Okay, to be honest, I purposely made them look a little alike so that customers will associate our products with their brand. So what? I don’t think that’s a big deal.

Vien: Our competitor has exclusive rights to use its logo. If ours is too similar, the trademark registry and the courts are going to nail us.

Bianca: So what do you want me to do?

Vien: Go back to the drawing board – literally!

### 0709 Taking Someone for Granted

Phil: Did you hear that Melissa has finally left Eric? It’s about time!

Cameron: Oh, that’s sad. It’s always sad when two people can’t make it work.

Phil: Well, it wasn’t for a lack of trying, on Melissa’s part. She bent over backwards trying to please Eric and he always took her for granted. If you ask me, Melissa was always too good for him.

Cameron: Really? I don’t know Eric too well, but he seemed nice.

Phil: Yeah, he’s nice on the surface, but he’s really a slimeball. Trust me, I know.

Cameron: I believe you, but what’s Melissa going to do now?

Phil: I think she should find a nice guy who’ll appreciate her.

Cameron: Someone like you?

Phil: She could do worse. I’d treat her right and make her happy.

Cameron: You sound like a man with a plan.

Phil: “Be prepared.” Isn’t that what the Boy Scouts say?

### 0710 Doubting One’s Language Use

Flora: Can you help me? I’m working on this email to Emil and I’m having trouble coming up with the right words in French.

Andy: My French isn’t much better than yours, but I’ll give it a shot.

Flora: Okay, read this sentence for me. What I want to know is if that is a suitable way to say that I’m sick, but that I’m not seriously ill.

Andy: Word choice can be tricky, but I think that’s the appropriate word, with the right meaning and the right connotations.

Flora: Okay, now read this sentence. It doesn’t sound right to me. Is this the right usage of the word “faire”? I really doubt it.

Andy: That’s because you’re using the wrong form of the verb, I think. Now if only I can think of the correct form. My French is really, really rusty.

Flora: Now that you’ve pointed out the problem, I can look it up later. What about this paragraph? The last sentence sounds awkward to me.

Andy: It sounds okay to me, but then again, I’m not a native speaker.

Flora: Ugh, this is so frustrating! It’s such a production every time I write him an email.

Andy: Maybe Emil will learn English and your troubles will be over.

Flora: Yes and maybe monkeys will fly out of my butt!

### 0711 A Difficult Place to Find

Ricardo: I’m making one more pass and if we don’t see a sign for the hotel, I’m heading back into town. I’m tired and I want a shower.

Marsha: I’m sure we’ll find it. When I talked to the desk clerk, she said that the hotel is hidden away behind some trees and to keep an eye out for their white sign.

Ricardo: Did she say blink and you’ll miss it? Because we’ve driven past this stretch three times and I don’t see a sign.

Marsha: She just said that they’re a little off the beaten path.

Ricardo: If they know that their hotel is so hard to find, why don’t they make it more prominent with some kind of landmark?

Marsha: That’s part of the charm of a small hotel hideaway. It doesn’t have neon signs and it’s tucked away far from the tourist areas.

Ricardo: That’s all good and fine, but we have to find it first. Okay, this is the last pass. Keep your eyes peeled.

Marsha: There it is! I’ve spotted the sign. It’s over there, see?

Ricardo: Yeah, now I see it. Geez, it’s like finding a needle in a haystack!

### 0712 Types of Business Entities

Ron: I’m only your tax accountant, but let me give you a piece of advice. If you’re planning to start a business, you’ll want to carefully consider what type of business entity you want to do business under.

Marcela: Is that important? My parents ran a mom-and-pop store for 40 years and they never had to think about stuff like that.

Ron: I don’t know about your parents’ business, but opening a store these days means having to think about the tax implications and liability issues.

Marcela: Liability issues?

Ron: Yes. What if somebody sues you? Without proper safeguards, a lawsuit could bankrupt you and your business.

Marcela: I’d never thought of that.

Ron: You’ll probably want to consider forming a corporation or an LLC. You’ll be a sole proprietor, right? You’re not going into business with someone else, are you?

Marcela: I’ll have two partners actually.

Ron: In that case, you’ll also want to think about things like the transferring of interests and the duration of the entity.

Marcela: Wow, starting a business is a lot more complicated than I thought.

Ron: My advice? Get a lawyer, and the sooner the better!

### 0713 Being Physically Strong

Takeshi: What do you want me to do with this piano?

Paula: I want you to move it from the living room to the family room. You’re as strong as an ox and that’s why I called you for help.

Takeshi: Lucky me. I don’t think I can move that piano by myself, though.

Paula: You’re built and have muscles coming out of your ears. Come on! Let’s put those muscles to work!

Takeshi: I haven’t been working out as much recently. I don’t think I’m up to the job.

Paula: I’ll cut you some slack. I’ll help.

Takeshi: What I’m trying to tell you is that you’ll need at least three big guys to move this piano. There’s no way around it.

Paula: Come on. Be a man. Suck it up! I’m willing to put my back into it, so let’s move this thing.

Takeshi: You are completely deluded if you think we’re going to move this piano one inch. I, for one, am not putting my back out trying to do the work of three!

### 0714 Dining with a Foodie

I invited my friend Nick to try a new restaurant with me. This restaurant was the latest thing, and since Nick was a foodie, I thought he would have an interesting take on the meal.

…

Anita: So, what did you think of the first course?

Nick: I thought it was passable.

Anita: Just passable?

Nick: Yes, it was a run-of-the-mill dish you could find in any fine dining restaurant. No gourmet would be bowled over by it.

Anita: Oh, I thought it was pretty good. What about the main course?

Nick: I thought the fish wasn’t seasoned properly and it was a touch overcooked.

Anita: I’m sorry to hear that.

Nick: And the wine pairing was all wrong.

Anita: I’m not a wine aficionado, so I guess my palate isn’t as sophisticated as yours. I thought the wine was wonderful.

Nick: Hmm, in my opinion, the entire meal was forgettable.

…

That was the last time I invited Nick to join me for a meal. I thought the meal was delicious, but Nick’s comments left a bad taste in my mouth!

### 0715 Outsiders Moving In

Leti: I am sick and tired of people coming from the big cities into our small town and buying up all of the houses and acting like they own the place.

George: This is a dying town and it needs fresh blood. I don’t hear the business owners complaining about the new infusion of money into the town.

Leti: Oh, yeah? Well, the flip side is that their spending is jacking up prices and making it harder for families who have lived here for generations.

George: The times are changing and we need to adapt.

Leti: I say that the newcomers are the ones who need to adapt. After all, they’re moving to our town.

George: With that kind of us against them mentality, there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers.

Leti: I look forward to that day.

George: All I have to say is beware what you wish for!

### 0716 Working Without Supervision

Veronica: Where’s Stan?

Kyle: He’s not here.

Veronica: When will he be back?

Kyle: I’m not sure. He hasn’t been here for a couple of days.

Veronica: A couple of days?! He’s supposed to be here overseeing the day-to-day operations. You’re his second-in-command. Where is he?

Kyle: I honestly don’t know. He’s been MIA since Tuesday.

Veronica: I come all the way here to talk to him about budget overruns and I find that he’s been shirking his responsibilities, too. I’ve a feeling he’s been phoning it in for a long time now. So have you been covering for him?

Kyle: Me? I’m just trying to do my job. When Stan isn’t here, I do my best to fill in. But I’m not saying anything against Stan.

Veronica: I appreciate your loyalty, but when push comes to shove, you’ve got to look out for yourself, right?

Kyle: Uh, I guess. I’m not sure.

Veronica: Well, I do. I need to look out for my best interests and that’s making sure this place has proper supervision. How would you like a promotion?

Kyle: You mean you’re firing Stan and giving me his job?

Veronica: Do you want the job or don’t you?

Kyle: Can I talk to Stan first? I don’t want him to think I’m a backstabber.

Veronica: You can…if you can find him.

### 0717 Starting a New School Year

Mom: It’s your first day at a new school. I’m worried about you.

Paul: Mom, I’ll be fine.

Mom: Do you have all of your books and supplies in your backpack? Oh and I’ve packed you a lunch already.

Paul: You didn’t have to do that, Mom. I was going to buy lunch at school.

Mom: Now you won’t have to. I hope you make some new friends. It’s no fun being a loner. It’s not that you have to be popular. I just don’t want you to feel left out.

Paul: I’ll be fine, Mom. I’d better go, or I’ll be late.

Mom: Do you think the school will do something special to kick off the new school year? I hope your teachers aren’t too strict. Oh, your backpack weights a ton! But you can leave most of your books in your locker, right?

Paul: They don’t have lockers at my new school, but I’ll be fine.

Mom: I hope the teachers don’t already have seating plans. I know you like to sit near the back of the classroom. And I hope you won’t have too much homework on the first day…

Paul: Mom, stop fussing. Everything will be fine.

Mom: You’re my baby and I’m worried about you.

Paul: Mom, I’m not starting kindergarten. I’m starting college, remember?

### 0718 Serving on a Jury

Samantha: How was your first day on a jury?

Jinho: It was okay. The judge swore us in and then we listened to the beginning of the prosecutor’s case. Two witnesses testified.

Samantha: That sounds exciting! I’d love to be on a jury. Why didn’t they sequester you? That’s what they do on TV.

Jinho: We didn’t need to be sequestered. This isn’t a high-profile case. Hey, guess what? I was selected as foreman.

Samantha: Wow, that’s a lot of responsibility.

Jinho: It’s no big deal. I think I was selected because nobody else wanted the job.

Samantha: What’ll happen tomorrow?

Jinho: We’ll hear the rest of the prosecutor’s case and then the defense attorney will put on her case. I’m sure the entire thing will be over in three or four days.

Samantha: Were there any interesting exhibits? Will the defendant take the stand?

Jinho: No, no interesting exhibits so far, and I’m not sure if the defendant will take the stand.

Samantha: I wish I were in your place. I’d love to put a criminal behind bars.

Jinho: You’re supposed to be impartial when you’re on a jury, remember?

Samantha: Oh sure, I’d only convict the guilty defendants – just like on TV!

### 0719 Eating Unhealthy Foods

Helen: So, what’s for lunch?

Gabe: Since you were nice enough to spend your Saturday morning helping me out, I’ll make sandwiches for lunch. I know it doesn’t sound like much, but I make a mean sandwich.

Helen: That sounds good, but you’re not going to use those cold cuts, are you?

Gabe: I was. Why?

Helen: Those are processed meats made with additives and a lot of sodium – definitely not what you’d want to put into your body.

Gabe: I eat these kinds of cold cuts all the time.

Helen: You shouldn’t if you don’t want to eat a lot saturated fat.

Gabe: Okay, how about if I make us salads.

Helen: Not with those greens. Unless they’re organic, they’re full of pesticides and chemicals.

Gabe: [sighs] All right, how about if I make us healthy smoothies?

Helen: Only if you use only fresh fruit. Bottled juices are full of high-fructose corn syrup. Yuck!

Gabe: I’ve got a great idea.

Helen: What?

Gabe: You pick the restaurant and I’ll buy you lunch.

Helen: I don’t want to put you to any trouble.

Gabe: It’s no trouble at all. [Said under his breath] I’d do anything to get you out of my kitchen!

### 0720 Buying Office Furniture

Natalia: Is that the Office Shop catalogue?

Kei: Yeah, I’m in charge of furnishing the new offices on the second floor. They need everything – desks, file cabinets, bookcases – you name it.

Natalia: That sounds like fun. I love shopping for new furniture. Can I help?

Kei: Yes, definitely. I’ve picked out a few things already, but I’m having a hard time deciding among all of these office chairs.

Natalia: Get this one. They’re on casters and are fully adjustable.

Kei: Okay, what about desks? Everybody has a different idea about office desks.

Natalia: I like this one. It’s got a keyboard tray, file drawers, and space for lateral files. See?

Kei: All right, I guess that one is as good as any, but what about this one with a hutch?

Natalia: This desk has an optional hutch. If the new employees want a hutch, they can order one later.

Kei: Okay, last but not least, we need bookcases.

Natalia: These are solid wood and look sturdy. What do you think?

Kei: I think there’s one person who’s cut out for this job, and that person is not me!

### 0721 A Widespread Epidemic

Alan: Did you see today’s news? There’s been an outbreak of Podcaster’s Disease in the city.

Katja: Oh, my God, not Podcaster’s Disease! I would not want to come down with that.

Alan: The first outbreak was at the local high school, and the health authorities thought it was localized. But a second, more widespread, outbreak has been reported at the city’s government offices.

Katja: That’s terrible! I thought Podcaster’s Disease was very rare.

Alan: It is, and that’s why the authorities are so alarmed. It’s highly communicable, so they’re hoping it won’t turn into an epidemic, or worse, a pandemic.

Katja: I’ve heard that this disease is horrible, but I’m not sure what the symptoms are. Do you know?

Alan: From what I’ve read, sufferers of Podcaster’s Disease can’t stop talking and they speak in an announcer’s voice all the time.

Katja: Oh, my God, what a terrible fate!

### 0722 Talking About Television Shows

Cleo: The new TV season is starting this week and I can’t wait. I’ve been watching reruns all summer and I’m ready for the premiers of my favorite shows.

Victor: You watch Madwomen, right?

Cleo: Yes, it’s my favorite show.

Victor: Then I’ve got some bad news for you. It’s been cancelled.

Cleo: How is that possible? The show was on hiatus last season because of contract negotiations, but I heard that it had been renewed for another season. The season finale was a cliffhanger!

Victor: I know, but something must have gone wrong. They filmed two episodes, which they’ll air, but then there’ll be a mid-season replacement.

Cleo: This is outrageous! I’ve been waiting nearly two years for its return. Oh well, at least I can watch my other favorite show tonight, Reviver.

Victor: Sorry, but it’s been preempted. The president is giving a televised speech tonight.

Cleo: Are you kidding me?!

Victor: Nope, sorry.

Cleo: The world is conspiring against me. I’ve had enough. I’m giving up TV watching!

Victor: You? That I’ve got to see!

### 0723 Things Associated with Autumn

Erin: Smell that!

Sean: Smell what?

Erin: Can’t you smell the changing of the seasons? I love autumn. The fall colors are out and there’s a chill is in the air.

Sean: That means I’ll be raking leaves every weekend when I should be watching football.

Erin: How can you be so grumpy when you see cute little squirrels squirreling away their nuts for the winter?

Sean: That just means they’re running across the roof even more often, waking me up every morning.

Erin: Not even you can put a damper on my good mood. I can’t wait for homecoming games and especially the harvest festivals. They’ll be hayrides, bonfires, and s’mores!

Sean: As you know, I have hay allergies and those bonfires are a danger to the environment. And I don’t like s’mores, in the summer or in the fall.

Erin: How can you be such a party-pooper?

Sean: The only good thing about the fall is that it’s right before winter when bears go into hibernation, so I won’t have to worry about running into one. Hey, what’s this?

Erin: This is a cup of hot chocolate to put you in the fall mood. Drink up and we’ll go for a walk outside. It’s a beautiful day and a walk will help you see all that you’re missing.

Sean: I’ll drink the hot chocolate, but don’t expect any epiphanies.

### 0724 Being Impolite in Conversation

Angela: Ugh! I hate talking to Rebecca. Every time I ask her a question, she ignores me or sneers at me.

Ronny: Are you sure it’s not your imagination? She’s perfectly nice to me.

Angela: It’s not my imagination. When I try to tell her something, she cuts me off. When I try to explain something to her, she’s short with me or talks over me. I always get the feeling that she’s looking down her nose at me.

Ronny: Maybe she feels threatened by you.

Angela: How so?

Ronny: You’re younger, smarter, and better educated. She might feel like you’re after her job.

Angela: But I’m not! I just started here and I don’t have any designs on replacing her.

Ronny: And you’re prettier than she is.

Angela: What does that have to do with anything, even if it were true?

Ronny: Well, she’s had a thing for me for a while and…

Angela: And she thinks I’m her competition. No wonder she’s so standoffish with me. I’ll just make it clear that I won’t stand in her way.

Ronny: You won’t?

Angela: Huh?

Ronny: Never mind.

### 0725 Childhood Illnesses and Diseases

Rebecca: You look exhausted! Another tough day at the daycare center?

Puneet: Yeah, it was. This is a record year for the kids getting sick. The chicken pox is going around. Last year, it was the measles. The year before that, it was the mumps. This year, it’s the chicken pox.

Rebecca: You sent the kids home, right?

Puneet: Yeah, but today, a couple of the kids looked like they have pink eye, and I had to call their parents to let them know.

Rebecca: What happened to simple nosebleeds and earaches?

Puneet: Oh, we have kids with those, too, but it’s the contagious diseases that really take its toll. I’m not sure, but I think one of the little kids has strep throat, and a couple of the really little kids have croup. I wish there were a way to immunize all of them from every illness and disease out there.

Rebecca: Are you sure you’re working in a daycare center?

Puneet: Yeah, why?

Rebecca: Because it just sounds like you’re working at the Center for Disease Control. Tomorrow, I suggest wearing a gas mask to work.

### 0726 Taking the Driving Test

Cesar: I just took the driving test. See this? That’s my new license.

May: You have to give me the play-by-play. I’m taking the test next week and I’m freaking out.

Cesar: There’s nothing to worry about. It was easy.

May: I’m not worried about the written test. It’s the driving test I’m worried about. I haven’t had a lot of practice. What did you have to do?

Cesar: Well, we got into the car and I fastened my seat belt. The examiner had me drive around the block, checking to see that I stopped at the stop signs and traffic signals.

May: That sounds okay. Did you have to drive on the freeway?

Cesar: Yeah, I went on the onramp and merged into traffic. She had me change lanes and accelerate to pass another driver. Just don’t forget to signal and don’t go over the speed limit.

May: Did you have to parallel park? That’s what I’m most worried about.

Cesar: Yeah, I parallel parked, but it was easy. Why are you so worried about the test?

May: I told you. I haven’t had very much practice.

Cesar: Exactly how many times have you been behind the wheel?

May: Well, a few times…maybe two times, and that was around a parking lot.

Cesar: Wow, you’d better get more practice if you’re going to take the test next week.

May: Could you…?

Cesar: Uh, sorry, but I’ve got someplace to be.

### 0727 Home Architectural Styles

Ralph: I just talked to our new real estate agent and she’s going to show us some houses tomorrow. I told her that the bigger the better and that we’re looking for a large Cape Cod or Georgian-style house.

Nina: You did? I’ve been thinking that we’d try to find something more modest, a bungalow or a cottage.

Ralph: What?! You think I’m going to live in a house that’s a step up from a mobile home? No way. We’ve come into some money and we’re going to buy a big house – maybe a colonial or a Greek revival.

Nina: If you want something bigger than a bungalow, how about a split-level modern house or maybe a ranch-style house?

Ralph: You’re still thinking too small. The sky’s the limit. We can afford something big, something really big.

Nina: That’s what the nouveau riche would do.

Ralph: So what? Our money is new and we have a lot of it, and I want a big house. We’re not being ostentatious. If anyone criticizes us for that, I’d say, “Deal with it!”

### 0728 Describing One’s Skill Level

Elaine: Welcome to your first day as an intern in our company office. Let me show you around. This is the main office area with a cubicle for each employee. Are you pretty good with computers?

Tony: Actually, my computer knowledge is pretty basic. The only thing I’m adept at is videogames. I’m not up to snuff on actually doing work on one.

Elaine: Okay, well you should be proficient by the end of your internship. Over there is where we keep the photocopier and fax machine. Have you used them before?

Tony: I’m an expert on the copier. I can use it with one hand tied behind my back. I’m particularly good at photocopying body parts.

Elaine: Uh, great.

Tony: But the fax…I’ve only used one once and I never quite mastered it.

Elaine: I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it pretty quickly. And this is the break room. You have your standard refrigerator and vending machines.

Tony: Hey, I’m really good with vending machines. That’s one machine I know inside and out.

Elaine: How could I have guessed that the one thing you really excel at is working the vending machine?

### 0729 Being Blunt and Stubborn

Simone: So, what did you think of Bruce? Isn’t he great?

Dirk: Well, he’s certainly direct and forthright with his opinions. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who speaks his mind the way he does.

Simone: Yeah, isn’t that great? I’ve never liked a guy who straddles the fence or has namby-pamby opinions. I’ve always liked guys with strong opinions.

Dirk: Well, there’s strong and there’s pigheadedness. Don’t you think?

Simone: What?! You think Bruce is pigheaded, just because he doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him? I think that’s an admirable trait.

Dirk: I think being blunt can be admirable under the right circumstances, but being stubborn as a mule can make it hard on other people, don’t you think?

Simone: No, I don’t. Other people can pull their punches if they want to, but a man who’ll speak up about what he believes in and stand by it is a real man to me.

Dirk: I can see why you two make a perfect couple. I hope never to be on the wrong side of an argument with either one of you.

### 0730 Waiting For Exam Results

Joel: Did it come?

Susanne: No, it’s not in today’s mail. Why do I bother, anyway? I know it’s a foregone conclusion. I’ve failed.

Joel: That’s bull! I know you passed. You’re just on tenterhooks waiting around for the results to arrive and you’re psyching yourself out.

Susanne: No, I’m not.

Joel: Don’t you remember that when you came home after taking the exam, you thought you had aced it?

Susanne: I did, but that was before I started thinking about all of the questions I got wrong. Then, I thought it was a toss up whether I passed or not. Now that I’ve had even more time to think about it, I’m sure I biffed it.

Joel: See what I mean? You’ve been psyching yourself out for weeks. You studied really hard and I have no doubt that you passed with flying colors. All right, you’re not going to hear today, so let’s get your mind off of the exam, okay?

Susanne: All right. How?

Joel: You can help me study for the exam. I’m taking it at the next administration. I have no intention of bombing it or even squeaking by by the skin of my teeth – like some people.

Susanne: Very funny. Okay, so maybe I’m psyching myself out – a little bit. Okay, I’m game. Where do we begin?

Joel: With all of the ones you thought you got wrong.

Susanne: What?!

Joel: There’s no sense wasting all that worrying. And if you did fail it, you’ll need to get ready to take it again.

Susanne: Gee, thanks!

### 0731 Hints and Innuendo

Roberta: You know, my birthday is coming up.

John: Yeah, I know. What are you getting at?

Roberta: Nothing. I was just thinking that it’s kind of an important birthday, a major birthday.

John: Yes, I know. Spit it out. What are you driving at?

Roberta: I was just thinking that some people might not know what to get me for such an important birthday, since some people don’t like to put a lot of thought into presents.

John: What are you implying? Are you insinuating that I don’t get you good presents for your birthdays?

Roberta: No, of course not. I just don’t want you to have to rack your brain to think of the perfect gift, that’s all.

John: Just tell me. What should I get you for your very important birthday?

Roberta: What? Just blurt it out? I can’t do that. I can give you a hint, but since you love me so much, I’m sure you can read my mind.

John: That’s where you’re wrong. If I had a nickel for every time a woman thought I should be able to read her mind, I’d be the richest man in the world! I don’t have an inkling of what you have on your mind.

Roberta: All right, I’ll make it more than a hint. I’ll give you three clues.

John: Great. That’ll make things crystal clear.

### 0732 Preferring Different Work Styles

Hugo: How do you like working with Leo? Is it working out?

Melissa: No, it’s not. Our work styles completely clash and we butt heads at every turn.

Hugo: Really? I thought you were partnered up because you complemented each other’s strengths.

Melissa: Yeah, but that doesn’t mean we can work well together. I’m collaborative and like to talk things out. Leo likes to go solo. He goes off on his own and comes back with a finished product, without consulting with me at all.

Hugo: Yeah, I’ve worked with Leo before and he likes having autonomy, but he has to realize that the point of collaboration is that the sum is greater than the parts. Two people pooling ideas will make the product better.

Melissa: That’s the idea, anyway. Hey, I have a better idea. What do you think of you and me teaming up? We’re both collaborative. We’d make a great team.

Hugo: Yeah, but we also have the same skills. That’s why you’re working with Leo and I’m working with Lamar, remember?

Melissa: Yeah, I remember. I’m starting to think that collaboration is overrated.

### 0733 Voting in an Election

Khaled: Are you going to the polling place or are you voting by absentee ballot again?

Bernice: I always vote with an absentee ballot so I can vote in the comfort of my own home and in my own time. In fact, I’ve already mailed in my ballot.

Khaled: Good for you. Which candidate did you vote for in the governor’s race?

Bernice: I didn’t vote for either of the bozos that are running. I voted for a write-in candidate.

Khaled: A write-in candidate? There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that a write-in candidate is going to win this election.

Bernice: That may be so, but I have to vote with my conscience, and I can’t bring myself to vote for either of those people. Have you voted?

Khaled: Not yet. I’m going to vote at the polls on Election Day. I want more time to think about whom to vote for and to read up on the ballot measures. There are a lot of them this time.

Bernice: Yeah, but the governor’s race is the only thing I care about. I can’t stand the thought of having either of those bozos as the next governor.

Khaled: Just out of curiosity, who did you write in as a candidate?

Bernice: You.

Khaled: Me?! You’re crazy. I don’t want to be governor.

Bernice: It was either you or me, and I’d rather not be a candidate and have to be in the company of those bozos.

### 0734 Believing in Scary Things

Ella: No matter what you say, I am not going out tonight. It’s Halloween and evil things are lurking everywhere.

Jimmy: Come on, it’s Halloween! It’s the holiday when kids get dressed up and ask for candy. There is nothing evil or creepy about this day. If you’re scared stiff, it’s your own doing.

Ella: Don’t kid yourself. This is the day when ghosts, witches, zombies, and vampires come out and have a field day. I’ve got goosebumps just thinking about it.

Jimmy: Do you mean you actually believe in all of that stuff? You are too old to be so gullible. I’m going out.

Ella: Look! Hurry up and close that door! There’s a black cat. Oh my God. If you walk out that door, the next time I see you, it might be in a graveyard.

Jimmy: You’re crazy and I’m leaving.

Ella: If you have to go, take these with you.

Jimmy: What are they?

Ella: It’s a cross and some garlic. You’ll thank me later.

Jimmy: Ugh!

### 0735 Getting a Visa to Travel

Yesenia: I have a great idea. Let’s plan a big party for your mother’s 70th birthday. We’ll invite all of your relatives from all over the world.

Julian: I don’t think very many of them can afford to travel half way around the world for a party.

Yesenia: I’ve already spoken to your rich brother and he’s already offered to pay for your family’s airfare and hotel. If we plan it, he’ll pay for it.

Julian: Julio offered to do that? Well, if he’s on board then we can give it a shot. But here’s another hitch. My extended family lives in a lot of different countries and I’m not sure they’ll get visas to visit the U.S., especially on short notice.

Yesenia: Let’s try, anyway. Your cousins in Canada don’t need a visa because most Canadian citizens don’t need one to cross the border. What about your uncle in Korea?

Julian: He’s already in the U.S. on an exchange visitor visa until June. He should be able to come.

Yesenia: What about your aunt in Greece?

Julian: She won’t need a visa because Greece is one of the countries in the Visa Waiver Program.

Yesenia: Do you think your nephews in South Africa will want to come?

Julian: I’m not sure what the visa situation is there. We’ll have to check with the State Department.

Yesenia: I’ll get on the horn first thing in the morning to see what I can find out. I might email them and ask them to check with the embassy or a consulate there to be sure. This party is really shaping up.

Julian: You seem to have it all under control.

Yesenia: Haven’t you always said that party planning is my middle name?

### 0736 Following One’s Dream

Cassandra: I’ve had it! I’m quitting and I’m not coming back. I was meant for greater things than working in this pathetic place. Life is passing me by.

Lazlo: You can’t quit. You need the money and you have responsibilities, remember?

Cassandra: I’ve sacrificed enough for security. I want to make a difference. I want to do big things. I want to have an impact on the world.

Lazlo: That’s very admirable. Most people want to make a difference in the world, but don’t have the guts to try.

Cassandra: You are so right! But I’m going to make it happen. I aspire to do great things and I won’t rest until I do. I want to follow my dream.

Lazlo: What is your dream?

Cassandra: Um, well, I’m not quite sure what I’m destined to do yet, but as soon as I figure out my true vocation, I’m following my heart.

Lazlo: That’s great. Until then, lunch break is over. Could we get back to work?

### 0737 Kitchen Appliances

Victoria: As you can see, this executive apartment is fully equipped. When you called and asked for the best available apartment, I thought of this one immediately. Just look at this kitchen! All of the appliances are top of the line.

Justin: Do you mind if I take a closer look? I like to cook.

Victoria: No problem. The refrigerator has a high capacity, with the freezer on the bottom.

Justin: But there’s no ice maker.

Victoria: No, that’s one of the few things it doesn’t have.

Justin: Hmm…Is this range gas or electric?

Victoria: It’s gas, and it has a broiler on the bottom, see?

Justin: Is the stove self-cleaning?

Victoria: I’m afraid not, but it’s stainless steel, as you can see.

Justin: That’s too bad. Is the dishwasher new?

Victoria: It’s not brand new, but it’s in very good condition. The microwave, toaster, and coffee maker also come with the apartment. What do you think? Do you think it’ll suit your needs?

Justin: When I asked for your best, I expected the Cadillac of apartments. You’ve shown me a Pinto!

### 0738 Talking to a Mechanic

Mechanic: Hi, I’m the mechanic. What can I do for you?

Amy: My car is making a very weird noise. It sounds like this: gulug, gulug, gulug…

Mechanic: Hm, that doesn’t sound good. Where is it coming from?

Amy: I’m not sure. When I’m in the car, it sounds like it’s coming from the engine, but when I get out of the car, it sounds like it’s coming from directly under the trunk, maybe the muffler?

Mechanic: That’s not a noise a muffler would make. Let me take a look. Can you start the car and pop the hood?

Amy: Sure.

Mechanic: Well, I don’t hear the sound right now, but your battery needs replacing, you have a coolant leak, your carburetor needs adjusting, and your spark plugs are shot. I need to look under the car.

Amy: Okay, go ahead.

Mechanic: Your brake pads need replacing and your tires need balancing.

Amy: But are any of those problems causing that horrible noise?

Mechanic: I don’t know. I don’t hear the noise right now, so it’s hard to tell. But that’s all work you need to have done on this car anyway for it to run right. It’s only a matter of time before your car stops working if you don’t take care of those problems.

Amy: I come in with one problem and you find 10 others. I guess you should go ahead. What else can I do?

Mechanic: Um, buy a bus pass?

### 0739 Performing an Intervention

Petra: Hey, what’s going on here? Why are all of you here in my apartment?

Johann: Your family and close friends are here to perform an intervention. We feel that you have a problem that is negatively affecting your life and the lives of the people around you.

Petra: An intervention?! I don’t need an intervention. What am I supposed to be addicted to?

Johann: I think you know. Each of us can attest to your obsession and the consequences of that addiction. It is interfering with your work and your personal relationships.

Petra: No, it’s not. I can’t believe this. I feel cornered!

Johann: We just want to help you. We all agree that you need to see a therapist and maybe go into treatment.

Petra: You guys are all crazy. Is that an ultimatum?

Johann: Yes, I’m afraid it is. If you don’t stop your obsessive behavior, we’ll take that away.

Petra: What?! Take away my MP3 player? If you take away my MP3 player, how am I supposed to listen to ESL Podcast?

Johann: That’s the idea. Listening to ESL Podcast 14 hours a day is not healthy.

Petra: Okay, I know I’ve gone overboard, but I’ll stop. I promise.

Johann: You’ll stop cold turkey?

Petra: Well…I need to be weaned off, I think. How about if I cut back to 10 hours a day to start?

### 0740 Corporate Gift-Giving

Michelle: Why did I get stuck with buying corporate gifts for our clients this year? Just because I’m a woman doesn’t mean I’m good at buying gifts.

Rafiq: It’s not because you’re a woman. It’s because you’re the most junior employee of the company. I had the job three years ago when I started working here.

Michelle: Oh, so you know the drill. I was thinking of sending food baskets to McQ Corp.

Rafiq: I wouldn’t advise doing that. We’re bidding on a new contract with their company and the gift could be misconstrued as a bribe. You’ll want to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

Michelle: Then I shouldn’t send anything at all?

Rafiq: You could send a charitable donation in the company’s name. This way, we show our appreciation for their business, and they get recognition for the contribution to a worthy cause, without seeming like we’re trying to influence their decision.

Michelle: That seems like a good way to go. What about the other companies we’re doing business with?

Rafiq: A food basket would be fine for those companies. Just make sure there’s nothing perishable in them and send a handwritten note. That adds a nice touch.

Michelle: I was also thinking of sending our smaller clients calendars and t-shirts with our company logo. What do you think?

Rafiq: I think they’d like gift certificates to stores or restaurants better.

Michelle: What about a bottle of wine? Wouldn’t that be a good gift?

Rafiq: You never know how a client feels about alcohol, so stick to something safer, like the food baskets or gift certificates.

Michelle: You have all the answers. You’re an expert at corporate gift-giving!

Rafiq: Shh, don’t say that too loudly. If the powers that be hear about it, I might get stuck with the job – permanently!

Michelle: Your secret is safe with me.

### 0741 Playing in a Tournament

Irene: How is your team doing in the standings?

Kent: They’re seeded sixth and they’re in a bracket with one of the best teams in the tournament. Our team has already lost to them.

Irene: I thought it was a double-elimination tournament.

Kent: It is. That’s the only reason they’re not out of contention for the title.

Irene: Why did the organizers get rid of the round-robin rounds?

Kent: I think it’s because they wanted to cut down on the number of games overall. I’m not sure.

Irene: Your team is the defending champion. What happened this year? Why aren’t they ranked higher?

Kent: They didn’t have a very good season. There were a lot of injuries, and as the coach, I had some run-ins with a couple of the new players. Let’s just say we had some clashes in personality.

Irene: Isn’t there a game this afternoon?

Kent: Yeah, but I have to feed my team first. They won’t play until they get what they want.

Irene: What do they want?

Kent: Ice cream. Who knew six-year-olds could be so demanding?

### 0742 Admiring Someone from Afar

Perry: Look at her! What I wouldn’t give to get a date with her.

Lynn: You should go talk to her and ask her for her number.

Perry: No way! She’s completely out of my league. See that guy she’s talking to? He’s the kind of guy who’ll get her number.

Lynn: That guy has nothing on you. The only thing that guy has that you don’t is confidence.

Perry: See? She’s giving him her number. I don’t have a chance.

Lynn: But look what he’s doing with it. He’s throwing it away. What a jerk! Wait here.

Perry: Hey, where are you going?

Lynn: I’ve got it. Here it is. Here’s her number. Call her.

Perry: Call her?! Out of the blue? You’re crazy. She’ll think I’m some kind of creep.

Lynn: No, she’ll think you’re being bold. She’ll love that.

Perry: What am I supposed to say to her? “Hi, I stole your phone number and I’d like a date.”

Lynn: No, tell her the truth. Tell her you saw her, admired her from afar, and wanted to ask her out.

Perry: What if she asks me how I got her number?

Lynn: Tell her you’ll tell her that when you see her on your first date. You’ll come off as mysterious. She’ll eat it up.

Perry: I can’t do it. There’s no way I could do that, could I?

Lynn: Yes you can. After all, no guts, no glory!

### 0743 Writing a Story

Xavier: How’s your novel coming along?

Sara: It’s not. I abandoned it for now. I think I bit off more than I can chew. Now, I’m working on a short story.

Xavier: That sounds interesting. Who are the main characters?

Sara: I’m not sure yet. Character development is really important so I need to give the characters themselves some serious thought.

Xavier: Okay, tell me about the general plot. Is it an adventure, romance, horror story – what?

Sara: I haven’t decided that either.

Xavier: All right. What about the setting? Is it going to be set in the U.S.?

Sara: Hmm, that’s still up in the air, too. I’m thinking of writing a period story, but I’m not sure what time period to choose. That’ll help decide the actual setting.

Xavier: I’m guessing you haven’t decided the point of view of the story either, whether it’ll be told in the first person or third person, am I right?

Sara: You are. I know. I have a lot to think about.

Xavier: You’ve definitely got your work cut out for you.

Sara: I know. I’m just waiting for some inspiration.

Xavier: Good luck with that.

### 0744 Dealing With a Mistake

Boss: What is going on here?!

Jenny: There was a miscommunication.

Boss: A miscommunication?! There are 16 copiers in this office. Who ordered 16 copiers?

Jenny: No one did. Clearly wires got crossed somewhere. I’ll try to get to the bottom of this, but the copiers will be removed before lunch.

Boss: I can’t even walk to my office with all of these machines in here. How am I supposed to get any work done?

Jenny: I’m looking for the purchase order right now to see if the mistake was on our end or on their end.

Boss: Let me know as soon as you figure it out. I want to know who’s responsible for this.

Jenny: Right, I’ll let you know. No doubt it was just a clerical error. No harm, no foul.

Boss: No harm, no foul?! This screw up has cost me half a day’s productivity. I think that’s plenty of harm done.

Jenny: You’re right, sir. I stand corrected. I’m sure it was just an honest mistake.

Boss: Stop making excuses for the person responsible for this debacle. Jenny, why are you making excuses for the person responsible?

Jenny: You look thirsty. I’ll go get you some coffee right now!

### 0745 Welcoming a Houseguest

Yousef: Why are you rearranging the furniture?

Rachel: My Aunt Susan called and she’s coming for a visit. It’ll be so nice to see her. It’s been a while since we’ve had a houseguest.

Yousef: Your crazy Aunt Susan? The one who talks to herself all the time and makes funny noises?

Rachel: Don’t be like that. She’s a little eccentric, but she has a heart of gold.

Yousef: How long is she staying?

Rachel: She was a little vague about that. We’ll just play it by ear.

Yousef: I don’t like the sound of that. Open-ended invitations are a bad idea.

Rachel: She won’t outstay her welcome. As far as I’m concerned, she can stay for as long as she wants. You don’t mind, do you?

Yousef: Speak for yourself. I don’t like having houseguests. They hog the TV and I can’t walk around the house in my underwear. I feel restricted.

Rachel: That’s a small price to pay for her interesting company, don’t you think? We’ll have so much fun listening to her stories.

Yousef: I think you’re making some unwarranted assumptions here. First, you assume that I enjoy her company. Second, you assume that I’ll be here.

Rachel: What do you mean? You won’t be here next week?

Yousef: Next week, I’ll be visiting my brother in Toronto. Didn’t I already mention it?

### 0746 Traveling Over the Holidays

Sabrina: You look like you’re getting ready for battle.

Ying: In a way, I am. I’m flying home next week to be with my family over the holidays and you know what holiday travel is like.

Sabrina: I’ve flown during peak travel season before, and now, I try to avoid it at all costs.

Ying: Well, I can’t this year, so I’m arming myself for the experience. I booked my flights back in September and I have my seat assignment. I’ll print out my boarding passes before I head for the airport, and I’ll keep checking the flight status to make sure the flight is on time.

Sabrina: I hope you don’t have any tight connections.

Ying: I change planes in Chicago, but I have two hours in between flights. I’m hoping that’ll be enough.

Sabrina: What’s in that huge bag?

Ying: Those are my supplies. If I get snowed in or if my flight gets cancelled, I’m ready to spend the night in the airport.

Sabrina: Wow, you really thought this out. You’re ready for the worst-case scenario.

Ying: Forewarned and forearmed. You won’t catch me napping!

### 0747 Visiting a Ranch

Piero: What’s all this?

Annie: I’m visiting my sister and brother-in-law’s new ranch next month and I’m getting ready for it. I know I’m a city girl, but I plan to fit right in on that ranch and work alongside all of the other cowboys.

Piero: Well, you look the part. You’ve got your cowboy hat, a lasso, and are those chaps?

Annie: Yes, of course. How else could I ride with them on the cattle drive?

Piero: Cattle drive? Are you sure it’s a working ranch?

Annie: I think so. Why would they buy a ranch if they don’t plan to have horses and livestock?

Piero: Don’t ask me. What’s all that stuff in the bags?

Annie: That’s all equipment I’ll need to ride a horse: a bridle, a bit, and ta-da – my own saddle!

Piero: This is all stuff that they should have at the ranch already, don’t you think?

Annie: Yes, but I’ll need to go horseback riding this weekend to practice.

Piero: That’s a good idea. Have you been riding horses long?

Annie: This weekend will be my first time.

Piero: You’re riding a horse for the first time this weekend and you plan to work at your sister’s ranch next month?

Annie: Sure, how hard could it be? It’s just like riding a bike, right?

### 0748 Writing a Letter of Inquiry

I was laid off from my job three months ago. Since then, I’ve been pounding the pavement looking for another job. So far, nothing has turned up, so I decided to take the bull by the horns and deliver inquiry letters to every company that might have a job opening.

…

Dear Ms. Smith (or the name of their personnel officer):

I am writing to inquire about any job openings you may have for someone with my experience and qualifications. I worked for six years as a software engineer for McQ Corp. and I have extensive training and experience related to software development.

I have enclosed a copy of my résumé. I would appreciate an opportunity to speak with you regarding any openings you may have or any consulting work your company requires.

Thank you for your consideration, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Steve Woz

…

I’m planning to personally deliver each letter, with the hope of talking with someone in the company. It is going take a lot of time and legwork, but I have no intention of sitting home and twiddling my thumbs while I wait for my next job!

### 0749 Getting Standard Medical Test Results

Judith: I had my annual physical two weeks ago and I just got a copy of the lab results, but I can’t figure out what they mean.

Steven: Let me take a look. The results of your blood tests are good. Your cholesterol is within the normal range, your glucose levels are fine, your hormone levels are good, and your red and white blood cell counts are normal, too.

Judith: That’s good news.

Steven: You did well on your EKG stress test and your bone density scan is fine.

Judith: Really? That’s great. What about the other results?

Steven: There appears to be no problems with your Pap smear or mammogram results, either.

Judith: I’m really glad to hear that. I hate going through those exams. I’m glad I don’t have to do them more often.

Steven: Just be glad you’re not a man.

Judith: Why’s that?

Steven: If you were a man, you’d have to have a PSA…and a DRE.

Judith: A what?

Steven: You don’t want to know.

### 0750 After Christmas Sales

Roxana: Get up! We’re going to miss out on the best deals if we don’t get to the stores when they open.

Kurt: What? I’m sleeping. Leave me alone.

Roxana: You need to get up now and come with me to the store for the after Christmas sales. You know that they slash prices and everything is on sale.

Kurt: We just spent the past few weeks shopping for Christmas presents and now you want to shop some more?

Roxana: We can stock up for next year. There’ll be deep discounts on all of the Christmas decorations and supplies, not to mention all of the winter clothing and seasonal toys. Let’s go!

Kurt: You go. What do you need me for?

Roxana: I need you to run interference while I go for the best bargains and to hold all of the bags and packages while I shop. What else?

Kurt: When I agreed to “for better or for worse,” I didn’t anticipate this!

### 0751 Describing One’s Taste in Music

Arturo: What are you listening to?

Ling: Some new music. You want to hear it?

Arturo: All right. That’s pretty mellow, kinda bluesy, isn’t it? It’s got an interesting indie feel.

Ling: Do you like it?

Arturo: It’s all right. I like more funky, dance music myself, but this is okay. It’s not too depressing.

Ling: That’s faint praise.

Arturo: No, no, I do like it. I guess I’m usually in the mood for more up-tempo music, something with a driving beat. I’m a hard-core MC-Quillan fan, if that’s any indication.

Ling: Oh, I see, so you don’t really like acoustic music much.

Arturo: It’s just not my thing, you know?

Ling: Yeah, that’s too bad.

Arturo: Why?

Ling: That was a track I recorded last week.

Arturo: This is your music? In that case, I love it.

Ling: You’re just saying that.

Arturo: No, really, it’s growing on me. In fact, I want to hear more. How about if I bring over some dinner on Saturday and you can play me a few more tracks?

Ling: You don’t mind?

Arturo: Believe me, I’ll be all ears.

### 0752 Working With Unreliable People

Paul: What time is it?

Jackie: It’s 2:30. The Cleveland office report should have been emailed to us by the end of the workday yesterday. What are we supposed to do now?

Paul: If we don’t get their report, we’ll have to hold up the production of the annual report and if that happens, somebody’s head is going to roll. This really leaves us in a lurch. Who’s responsible for the report in Cleveland?

Jackie: Noel Simmons.

Paul: Oh, no. I know Noel. I used to work with him in the Columbus office. He was always dropping the ball on his responsibilities and I was always having to cover for him.

Jackie: You must have had the patience of a saint! If he’s such a flake, why is he still working for this company?

Paul: Beats me, but I know we’re in for a long wait if he’s in charge. We have to do something. Get on the phone and see if you can light a fire under him. Unless we keep on him, we’ll never see that report.

Jackie: Okay, I’ll call the Cleveland office right now.

Paul: And Jackie?

Jackie: Yes?

Paul: If he gives you a line or some kind of excuse, let me talk to him.

Jackie: What’ll you do?

Paul: I’ll take him on a trip down memory lane. When I used to work with him, I wasn’t always so patient – or polite.

### 0753 Enduring Hazing

Rafael: Go away and stop following us. Our club is for boys only.

Hannah: But I want to join.

Rafael: You do, huh? Did you know that to join our club, you have to go through an initiation?

Hannah: Okay, I’ll do that. What do I have to do?

Rafael: You have to endure weeks of hazing. We’ll be putting you through your paces to make sure you’re club material.

Hannah: I’m willing to do that. I can do anything you boys can do. Watch me!

Rafael: I’m not so sure. If you want to be one of the guys, you’ll have to do everything we tell you to do, even if you don’t want to.

Hannah: Everything?

Rafael: Yeah, everything. If we tell you to eat dirt, you have to eat dirt. If we tell you to stand outside in the rain, you have to do that, too. Get the picture?

Hannah: Yeah, I’ve got the picture.

Rafael: If we tell you to pull a prank, you have to do it. If we tell you to streak, you have to do that, too.

Hannah: You can’t be serious. That really crosses the line.

Rafael: We decide what crosses the line and what doesn’t. See? I knew you’d be too chicken to join our club.

Hannah: You’re right. I don’t want to join any club where the members are stupid enough to do all of those things. I’m starting my own club – one where you don’t have to humiliate yourself to get in.

Rafael: Suit yourself. I knew you weren’t club material.

Hannah: Thank goodness for that!

### 0754 Being in a Flood

Cherise: Well, that was a rude awakening at 2:00 in the morning!

Don: At least we got out of our room before it flooded. It serves us right for planning a vacation here during the rainy season. Our luggage is probably soaked.

Cherise: Oh, no, I’d forgotten about our clothes. If the water doesn’t recede soon, everything will have mold and mildew on it.

Don: The sump pumps are working as we speak. Hopefully, we can retrieve our stuff soon.

Cherise: Maybe I should go downstairs and try to salvage what I can, before things get washed away.

Don: What?! You could drown in all that water. Forget it!

Cherise: Drown in three feet of water? Don’t be silly.

Don: I’ve seen you swim. Come on, let’s just wait until we get the go-ahead.

Cherise: I still think I should try.

Don: I have one word for you: snakes.

Cherise: Enough said!

### 0755 Rejecting Newer Technology

Darlene: Thanks for agreeing to take a look at my computer. It’s been acting up lately.

Chris: Sure, I don’t mind. Is this it?

Darlene: Yeah.

Chris: How long have you had this computer? It looks like it belongs in the ice age.

Darlene: I admit it’s a little dated. I must be one of the last holdouts in switching to a newer model.

Chris: What are you waiting for? It seems to me that all of your computer problems would be solved if you spring for a new one.

Darlene: I have a lot of old programs on this computer that aren’t compatible with the newer models. I’m kind of attached to them.

Chris: They probably aren’t compatible because there are now better, more efficient programs that have overtaken the ones you currently use. Your programs are probably obsolete. Which programs are they? Maybe I can show you how to use the newer versions.

Darlene: Well, there’s one particular program…

Chris: Yes?

Darlene: It’s a game I like to play.

Chris: You’re refusing to buy a newer, better computer just because you’d have to give up a game?

Darlene: It’s a really fun game and I’m keeping this computer until they make a version for the newer computers.

Chris: Okay, but you know what they say: live by the sword, die by the sword.

Darlene: So you won’t help me fix my computer?

Chris: I’ll try, but I’m telling you now. It’s a lost cause.

### 0756 Holding Structured and Unstructured Meetings

Diego: Okay, why don’t you brief me on what you’ve planned for the meeting tomorrow?

Maya: Sure. At the meeting of the managers tomorrow, we’ll begin with introductions. Since you’re the most senior manager, the job falls to you.

Diego: I don’t think we need to stand on ceremony. Have Alexi do the introductions.

Maya: All right. Then, we’ll follow the agenda and discuss each item of business. I have you down to lead the discussions.

Diego: I don’t think we need the meeting to be so structured. If we follow the agenda point-by-point, we’ll never find out what’s really on the minds of the managers, what issues they think are of paramount importance. I think I’ll open the floor to anyone who wants to raise an issue.

Maya: Wouldn’t that turn into a free for all? I’m not sure we’ll get much accomplished.

Diego: Sometimes, it’s not as important to accomplish something as it is to take the pulse of the group. If we want to know what issues are on the managers’ minds, we first need to let the managers speak freely. Agreed?

Maya: Uh, sure. You’re the boss. Should I also cancel the lunch I’ve ordered so you can make up your minds about food later?

Diego: Absolutely not! The one thing that’s not open for discussion is what I’m eating for lunch.

### 0757 Getting Political Support

Helen: Okay, your schedule today is very busy. First, you’re meeting with a group of constituents concerned about the environment. Then, you’re speaking to a group of factory workers. At noon, you’ll be having lunch with a group of high-power donors.

Mikhail: When I signed on as a candidate, I had no idea I’d have to pander to every group out there to gain their support.

Helen: Don’t think of it as pandering. Think of it as rallying the troops. People in this state need a leader and you’re their great white hope.

Mikhail: I decided to run because I wanted to be a voice of reason in the partisan bickering. I didn’t sign on to be a poster boy for my political party.

Helen: You can make a difference when you get elected, but first things first: you need to get elected. Ready to go?

Mikhail: What happened to the good old days when all you had to do was a little gerrymandering to get elected?

Helen: I’m glad you brought that up. Your meeting with the committee on redistricting is this afternoon at 2:00.

Mikhail: I’m sorry I asked!

### 0758 Showing Off a New Purchase

Monica: Wow, check you out! When did you buy a new car?

Kevin: This isn’t just any new car. It’s a Ferrari.

Monica: I can see that. It must have set you back a few.

Kevin: Yeah, but it was worth it. You should see the looks I get riding around in this baby. My brother is green with envy.

Monica: Then you’ve been showing it off around town.

Kevin: No, I’ve just been showing it off to a few friends and family members. There’s no sense owning a fine machine like this and not bragging a little, right?

Monica: Especially since your brother has been gloating about his new boat, you mean.

Kevin: There is that. I don’t want to toot my own horn, but I think a new Ferrari trumps a measly new boat, don’t you?

Monica: Do you and your brother always whip it out like this?

Kevin: Like what? I’m just sharing my new toy with my brother. I’m sure he’s just as happy for me as I was for him when he bought his new boat.

Monica: Truer words were never spoken.

### 0759 Worrying About Your Children

Pavel: I’m really worried about Hanna. She’s been hanging around with that girl Carla, and Carla runs with the wrong crowd.

Hillary: Hanna is rebelling a little. That’s natural at her age. When I was her age, I thought I knew more than my parents or any adult, and that I should be able to make all of my own decisions.

Pavel: I’m not talking about being stricter on her, but she’s become so secretive. I’m really worried that she might get exposed to things that should be off-limits at her age.

Hillary: There’s no way we can keep her from seeing her friends short of locking her in her room. We have to trust her and let her come to us if she runs into problems. We raised her right and she can handle herself.

Pavel: I wish I had your confidence. She’s a girl, remember? All kinds of things can happen to girls.

Hillary: We’ve talked to her a lot about those things and what we feel are right and wrong. A lot of things can happen to boys, too, or don’t you remember? Hanna takes after you and she has your brains and resourcefulness. Like father, like daughter, so stop worrying so much,

Pavel: Do you really think she’ll be okay?

Hillary: Yes, I do. Take comfort in knowing that she’s just exactly like you. When she has a daughter of her own, she’ll stay up nights worrying, just like you.

Pavel: That’s small comfort!

### 0760 Paycheck Deductions

Bill: It’s about time! I’ve been waiting for my first paycheck and now it’s finally here. I’m ready to party this weekend! Whoa!

Carol: What’s the matter?

Bill: What happened to all my money? The amount of this check is a lot less than I expected it to be.

Carol: Yeah, my first paycheck was an eye-opener for me, too. Look at the pay stub and you’ll see all of the deductions. After federal income taxes, state income taxes, and FICA, you’re not left with a lot of money.

Bill: You’re right, but what’s FICA?

Carol: Those are taxes for Social Security and Medicare. Did you sign up for a retirement plan? If you did, those retirement contributions are deducted, too.

Bill: Thank God, I didn’t. But you know what? That still doesn’t account for all of the deductions.

Carol: Let me take a look. Oh, it looks like your wages are being garnished.

Bill: They’re garnishing my wages? What for?

Carol: Uh, do you have to pay child support or something like that?

Bill: Oh, yeah, I guess I do. I’d forgotten about that. I guess I’d better change my weekend plans.

Carol: I guess so.

### 0761 Animals in a Zoo

Deborah: I can’t wait to see the elephants at the zoo. I wish I could see them in their natural habitat, but a zoo is the next best thing.

Zach: I don’t want to go to a place where animals are kept in captivity. How would you like it if you were locked in a cage and gawked at all day?

Deborah: The animals in zoos are lucky. They have a nice, safe place to live away from predators, and their handlers make sure they never go hungry. Zoos preserve endangered species.

Zach: If you think it’s so nice living in zoos, I’d like to see you switch places with a lion or a monkey for a month and see how you like it.

Deborah: Animals aren’t people. They don’t have the same wants and needs.

Zach: That’s what you think. One day, the animals aren’t going to take it anymore. They’ll rise up and break their shackles.

Deborah: And will you be their ringleader?

Zach: No, I’ll be their cheering section. It’s about time animals get some respect.

Deborah: Have you seen Planet of the Apes?! I’ll reserve a cage for you!

### 0762 Eating a Family Dinner

My roommate, Jim, invited me over to his house for a family meal. I’m an only child, so I’m not used to a big family dinner. I felt like a fish out of water.

…

Jim’s mother: Sit down, everybody. Dinner’s ready.

Phil: Thank you for having me over, Mrs. Moreno.

Jim’s mother: Don’t mention it. Just sit down and eat. Jim, pass the potatoes, and Dana, don’t hog the peas. Hand them both to Phil.

Phil: Thank you, Mrs. Moreno, but I’ve already taken a helping of each dish.

Jim’s mother: Then you need to have seconds. You’re too skinny. Eat up!

Phil: This food is really good, but I don’t think I have the appetite for more. My plate is already overloaded.

Jim’s mother: All right, no more potatoes or peas, but you need more ham. Laura, serve Phil some more ham, and Jason, round up some more rolls.

Phil: No, no, please. I really couldn’t eat more than what’s already on my plate.

Jim’s mother: Don’t be ridiculous. I know you’re saving room for dessert. There’s an apple pie, a strawberry shortcake, a cheesecake, and some ice cream.

…

I now know why Jim only comes home for meals every once in a while. Eating like this more than once a week would give anybody a coronary!

### 0763 Dealing with an Apartment Super

George: Did you call the super about fixing the leaky faucet?

Louise: I called him on Monday, but I haven’t heard back yet.

George: Well, call him again. This window is stuck and it won’t close.

Louise: I’ll call him, but I think he’s avoiding our calls.

George: He’s the worst super we’ve ever had. He’s in charge of the maintenance around this place, but instead, he hides out in his apartment. Whenever there’s a problem, he tells us he’s too busy to get to it right away. Too busy doing what, I’d like to know.

Louise: Maybe he is overworked. There are 25 units in this building, so it’s conceivable that he’s busy making repairs – somewhere.

George: That’s what he’s counting on, people like you who give him the benefit of the doubt. All the while he’s drinking coffee and reading the newspaper somewhere. Mark my words.

Louise: I’ll call him again. Maybe we’ll catch him in his apartment.

George: Save your energies.

Louise: Where are you going and what are you doing with that baseball bat?

George: I’m going to track down that super and bring him back here. Come hell or high water, he’s making those repairs – today!

### 0764 Being Unsure and Unready

Aida: When our bigwigs from the Cleveland office arrive next week, I think we’ll have a lot to show them.

Dale: I wouldn’t be so sure about that. Giselle told me yesterday that it’s a toss up whether she’ll finish the program she’s working on by next week, but don’t quote me on that.

Aida: I thought she was already done with it.

Dale: I think that she’s still tinkering with it because she isn’t 100 percent sure she’s worked out all of the bugs.

Aida: All right. I hope she gets a move on and fast. I’ll still have Joe’s prototype to show them, right?

Dale: Well, the last time I spoke with Joe, he said that the prototype is still a work in progress. Whether it’ll actually work is iffy, at best.

Aida: Are you trying to tell me that we’re not ready for this visit at all?

Dale: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I wouldn’t count on having much to show them, sorry.

Aida: Then, what am I supposed to do when they want to see the progress on our work?

Dale: I suggest some fast-talking and fancy tap dancing!

### 0765 Annulling a Marriage

Courtney: Did you hear? Kate and Christopher are trying to annul their marriage.

Ray: What?! They’ve only been married for two months! What brought this on?

Courtney: I have no idea. Neither of them is underage or bigamists and they married of their own free will, so I don’t know how they can ask for an annulment.

Ray: I’ve heard that you can get an annulment if there’s some kind of fraud. Maybe they’re asking for the annulment on those grounds.

Courtney: Maybe. I wish I knew more. Ooh, could they be related by blood and didn’t know it? It’s sounding more and more like a soap opera.

Ray: I suppose we shouldn’t speculate. It’s sad when any marriage ends, even if it only lasted two months. Something must be really, really wrong.

Courtney: Or else…

Ray: Or else, what?

Courtney: Or else, Christopher finally figured out what a witch Kate is.

Ray: Oh, somebody’s a little catty today. Do I detect some jealousy here?

Courtney: Me? Jealous of Kate? Forget it! I’ve known her for years and I just wouldn’t wish her on my worst enemy!

### 0766 Describing Shapes and Sizes

Carson: Your apartment is going to look fabulous once I’m finished decorating it!

Brooke: I really appreciate you taking the time to help me choose some furniture, but I’d really like to keep the look conservative and traditional.

Carson: Nonsense! You have a fabulous new apartment and I’m going to help you make the most of it. Look at that oval mirror. It’ll look fantastic in your hall.

Brooke: That mirror is gigantic! I don’t think I want anything that size. How about this rectangular one?

Carson: That’s too puny for that space. Oh, look at this triangular bookcase. It would really complement the fireplace in the den.

Brooke: I don’t think that bookcase is very functional. The shelves are so narrow and it’s an odd shape. It really looks nice, but I need furniture that I can actually use. I like this one better.

Carson: How boring! You need something that makes a statement. How about this chair? It’s fabulous!

Brooke: It’s a humongous circle on the floor with a cushion on top of it. I don’t think anyone would ever sit on it.

Carson: Yes, but in design, you have to consider form before function.

Brooke: That’s where we differ. I actually have to live in this apartment, remember?

### 0767 Taking Care of Your Teeth

Martha: Oh, I have a toothache!

George: It sounds like you’re in for a visit to the dentist.

Martha: That would be the last resort. I hate going to the dentist. I don’t like needles and the sound of the drill scares me to death. I’m hoping the toothache will just go away.

George: You really should get that checked out. Do you want me to make an appointment for you with my dentist?

Martha: No, thanks. I haven’t seen a dentist in years and I don’t plan to now unless I have no choice.

George: Years?! You haven’t been to a dentist in years? Haven’t you ever heard of preventive care? You’re supposed to get a dental cleaning twice a year.

Martha: I don’t follow doctor and dentist guidelines like that. I brush my teeth every day. That’s good enough.

George: No, it’s not. You should be flossing every day and rinsing your mouth with mouthwash to keep your teeth and gums healthy. If you haven’t been to the dentist in years, I’m not surprised you didn’t know that.

Martha: Stop preaching! I’ll go to the dentist when I need to.

George: Like now.

Martha: Maybe. It doesn’t hurt that much anymore…

George: I never knew you were such a chicken.

Martha: [makes a chicken noise] Bwauk, bwauk…!

### 0768 Negotiating Price

Justin: Hello.

Rachel: Hi, Justin. It’s Rachel from McQ Corp.

Justin: Oh hi, Rachel. Did you get our bid for the job?

Rachel: Yes, we did. We like your proposal, but we still need to come to terms on the price.

Justin: We’ve already given you our rock-bottom price because we want to get this job, but we always try to be flexible.

Rachel: Good. Could you do better on what you’ve quoted us for labor? The price seemed a little high.

Justin: We might be able to trim a little off of that. How about if we discount that by 10 percent?

Rachel: That’s an attractive offer, but we were hoping for 20 percent.

Justin: You’re driving a hard bargain. We have certain fixed costs, you know.

Rachel: I do and that’s why I’m only asking about labor costs. Can you meet me halfway at 15 percent?

Justin: I think that might be doable, if that’s the only stumbling block to us getting the job.

Rachel: I can’t make any promises, but I’ll do my best.

Justin: That’s all I can ask. I’ll send you over a revised bid.

Rachel: Great. I hope to have good news for you next week.

### 0769 Trying Unusual Foods

Antonio: What is that smell?! It stinks!

Candace: This is a dish my roommate taught me to make. It’s really good. Want a bite?

Antonio: You’ve got to be kidding me! You actually eat that? You can stomach something that smells that foul?

Candace: Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. I admit that it’s an acquired taste, but once you develop a taste for it, you’ll not only like it, you’ll crave it like I do.

Antonio: I would never crave something that unappetizing. You’ve gone over the edge. I’ve always known you were weird, but this takes the cake.

Candace: You need to open your mind to new culinary experiences. You need to wake up your taste buds. Your palate will thank you for it. If you try it, you might like it.

Antonio: If I try it, I may puke!

### 0770 Joining a Tour

Darrel: What are you looking at?

Alice: Tours for our vacation. I was thinking that it’d be hard for us to get around on our own, so I think joining a tour is a good idea.

Darrel: Really? I thought we’d make our way around leisurely to see the sites. I don’t like the fast pace of tours. I’d rather have the time to take in each site, not rush through it just to say I’ve been there.

Alice: Tours come in all shapes and sizes. I’m sure we can find one that isn’t too fast-paced or strenuous for you.

Darrel: And I don’t want to eat all my meals with the tour group. I want some time to explore on our own.

Alice: All right, I’m looking at a tour that has the perfect itinerary. It’s also gotten rave reviews. It includes a tour guide, all admission fees, accommodations, ground transportation, and most of the meals. And there are several free mornings and afternoons built-in so we can explore on our own.

Darrel: I don’t know.

Alice: The alternative is for you to plan each stop of our trip.

Darrel: A tour is sounding better and better.

### 0771 Commuting by Train

Lisa: Can you tell me if this is the right platform for the train to Arlington?

Omar: Yes, it is. Is this your first time taking the train?

Lisa: Is it that obvious?

Omar: No, you just look a little lost.

Lisa: I’m starting a new job and I have to commute to work for the first time.

Omar: Oh, I see. Did you buy a ticket at the ticket machine?

Lisa: Yes, I did, when I entered the station. I hope I bought the right one.

Omar: Let me see. Yes, that’s the right one. The good news is that I haven’t heard any announcements about the train being delayed, like it has been a couple of times this week, so it should be on time.

Lisa: I’m relieved to hear that. I can’t afford to be late to work on my first day. Will I need to show this ticket to get on the train?

Omar: Not when you get on. After the train is under way, the conductor will walk down the aisle to collect it.

Lisa: Oh, I see, thanks. That sounds simple.

Omar: It is simple if you can actually find a seat. It can be pretty crowded on these commuter trains. Sometimes it’s standing room only.

Lisa: Let’s hope for the best.

Omar: Stick with me. I’ll elbow a few people out of the way to get you a seat.

Lisa: [laughs] Thanks, I think.

### 0772 Types of People at Work

Raul: Thanks for showing me around on my first day.

Ursula: It’s no problem. I want to give you the lay of the land and tell you about the people you’ll be working with. For instance, that’s Julie over there. She’s really nice, but she’s also a perfectionist. If you ever work with her, remember that she’s a stickler about everything.

Raul: Okay, I’ll remember that.

Ursula: And Phil over there? He’s a slacker and a troublemaker. Stay away from him, far, far away.

Raul: Thanks for the warning.

Ursula: And that’s Luis. You’ll be working under him. He’s a slave driver and a workaholic, and he expects everybody else to be one, too.

Raul: That doesn’t sound good.

Ursula: Don’t sweat it. Standing next to Luis is Gil. He’s a yes-man and very, very ambitious, almost ruthless. Don’t get in Gil’s way.

Raul: Okay, I won’t. Thanks for showing me around. By the way, who’s the office gossip?

Ursula: Oh, we don’t have one of those around here.

### 0773 Dealing With Debt

Kristin: Let’s go shopping!

Ed: Wait a second. What are all these?

Kristin: They’re bills, but they don’t have to be paid yet. Don’t worry. Let’s go! There’s a new pair of shoes with my name on it.

Ed: Hold on a minute. This is a notice saying that you’re behind on your house payments and if you don’t pay soon, your house will go into foreclosure.

Kristin: Oh, they’re just bluffing. I’m only a little behind in my payments. I’ll get to it next week.

Ed: And this is a notice from your bank telling you that your car is being repossessed because you haven’t made a car payment in three months. Is that true?

Kristin: I refuse to look at anything as boring as a bill today.

Ed: And these are from the power company and the phone company. They’re going to cut off your services if you don’t pay now.

Kristin: If I could just charge those payments, I’d be okay.

Ed: Not with these credit cards. You’re maxed out. I’m surprised you haven’t heard from collection agencies already.

Kristin: Maybe I have. They can hound me all they want, but I’m not that behind on my payments. I’m tired of waiting. I’m going shopping with or without you.

Ed: You’re on your own. I refuse to help you toward your financial ruin!

### 0774 Describing Height and Build

Gwen: Do you see that heavyset guy over there, the one towering over everyone else?

Denzel: Yeah, what about him?

Gwen: He’s my ex-boyfriend. I haven’t seen him in years. When I knew him he was really skinny. He’s really put on a few pounds. It’s amazing what a few years can do.

Denzel: None of us are as svelte as we used to be.

Gwen: That’s true enough. I’m not as petite as I used to be, that’s for sure.

Denzel: How come you’ve never mentioned this ex-boyfriend before?

Gwen: Oh, I’d almost forgotten about him. Oh, no. I hope that guy over there didn’t see me.

Denzel: Who? That short, stocky guy?

Gwen: No, the average height guy who’s walking this way. He’s another one of my exes. I’d hoped never to see him again.

Denzel: It was a bad breakup?

Gwen: Right. Let’s head toward the door.

Denzel: Why hadn’t you mentioned him before?

Gwen: I thought I had. There have been so many…

Denzel: Don’t look now, but your ex is also headed toward the door.

Gwen: Which one?

Denzel: The tall medium build guy walking next to you!

### 0775 Making Repairs on the Outside of a House

Maggie: Watch out! Are you okay?

Conrad: I’m fine, but I almost tripped over that crack in the driveway. We’ve got to get that fixed.

Maggie: I know it’s a hazard, but first things first. We should fix those broken front steps, don’t you think?

Conrad: I see what you mean.

Maggie: And we have to repair that part of the fence that’s falling down. See? If it leans any more, we won’t be able to open the gate.

Conrad: Oh, I didn’t realize the fence was falling down. Yes, you’re right, we should take care of those things first.

Maggie: And the porch light is out. I’m not sure if we just need to replace the bulb, or if it’s an electrical issue.

Conrad: I didn’t realize the outside of our house was in such disrepair. I’ve been traveling too much for work.

Maggie: I admit I’ve been putting off the repairs, too.

Conrad: All right, I know what we’ll be doing this weekend – all weekend!

### 0776 Getting Praise and Recognition

Rene: Hey, look who’s here. It’s the company’s golden boy.

Bruno: Very funny.

Rene: I’m not joking. First, you’re recognized at the annual meeting for your work in the company, and then you get a commendation from the city for your volunteer work. I’m basking in your reflected glory.

Bruno: I didn’t ask for either honor, as you well know. I’m not a glory hound.

Rene: Yes, and that’s what makes it even more galling. You don’t have to go seeking your glory; it comes to you.

Bruno: Knock it off! I like praise as much as the next guy, but I’d rather not be in the limelight.

Rene: I know. You’re exceptional and you’re modest about it. You’re the perfect guy. You leave us mere mortals in the dust.

Bruno: I’m leaving. I know you love giving me a hard time, but remember this: I give as good as I get – and I have a long memory!

### 0777 Supplies for Outdoor Recreation

Jim: I shouldn’t have let my brother pack my supplies for this trip. I was running late and he offered to do it.

Fumiko: What’s the problem?

Jim: He doesn’t know the first thing about hiking or camping. Look at this! My backpack is filled with bottles of water!

Fumiko: What’s wrong with that?

Jim: He should have just packed me a water filter, instead of all these heavy bottles to lug around. And he forgot some of the most important supplies, like bug spray and a flashlight.

Fumiko: You’re welcome to borrow any of our supplies. Here’s some bug spray. Do you need matches?

Jim: Yeah, I do. My brother packed matches, but not in a waterproof bag. One of the bottles of water leaked and got them all wet. At least my tent and cook stove were spared.

Fumiko: Maybe your brother is telling you something.

Jim: What?

Fumiko: Maybe he wants to be included in your camping trips. Then, he’ll learn what to do and what to bring.

Jim: You might have something there.

### 0778 Getting Your Pocket Picked

Lenny: Wait a second. Where’s my wallet?

Anita: It’s not in your back pocket?

Lenny: No, it’s in none of my pockets. My pocket’s been picked!

Anita: It must have happened when our attention was diverted by those boys fighting over there.

Lenny: I should have been paying more attention in a busy market like this. I felt someone bump me from behind, but it never occurred to me that someone could be lifting my wallet.

Anita: I’ve been clutching my purse, worried about purse-snatchers. I never thought anyone would be able to pick your pocket.

Lenny: Me, neither. I don’t know how I’m going to live this down. When the boys hear about this…

Anita: Come on, we’d better go file a police report. You never know. Maybe your wallet will turn up.

Lenny: Fat chance of that happening. This is really embarrassing…

Anita: Stop stalling. If there’s one thing I’ve learned after being a cop’s wife for 15 years is that you’ve got to face the music.

### 0779 Giving CPR

Joyce: Lie down on the floor.

Steve: Why?

Joyce: I have to practice for my CPR exam tomorrow. I’m taking it so I can get my CPR certification. Lie down please.

Steve: Okay, okay. Now what do I do?

Joyce: You just lie there and pretend to be unresponsive, like you’re in cardiac arrest. Okay, I need to determine your heart rate and if you’re breathing or not. Then, I check to see that your airway isn’t blocked.

Steve: Hey, get your fingers out of my mouth!

Joyce: Lie still! You’re lucky I don’t have to administer artificial respiration.

Steve: Thank God for small favors!

Joyce: But I do need to practice restoring your circulation by doing chest compressions.

Steve: Ouch, that hurts!

Joyce: You’re supposed to be unresponsive, remember? Hold still while I get the defibrillator.

Steve: Oh, no, you don’t! From now on, as far as you’re concerned, I’m a case of do not resuscitate!

### 0780 Being Sued

Ally: Hello, Ally McNeal.

Jerry: Ally, this is Jerry Mason. I need to talk to you right away. We’re being sued and we’ve just been served. This is one of those times I wish we had in-house counsel.

Ally: Jerry, you know that our firm will do its best to represent you, as we’ve done in the past. You can count on me and all of the attorneys in this office. How about if I come to your office this afternoon and we can discuss it?

Jerry: Okay, that’s great.

Ally: In the meantime, can you give me a brief rundown?

Jerry: Yeah, we’re being sued for negligence. In fact, it’s a class action suit against our company

Ally: All right. Can you fax or email me the papers so I can see what they’re alleging?

Jerry: Yes, I can do that. We really need your help with this, Ally. A lawsuit like this could ruin a company like ours.

Ally: Don’t panic. We’ll take a look at it and see if there’s any merit in the case. It might just be a frivolous lawsuit.

Jerry: If they have a case, you’ll have to find a loophole to get us out of this, or negotiate a settlement. The last thing I want is to go to court.

Ally: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll discuss it this afternoon. And Jerry?

Jerry: Yeah?

Ally: In the meantime, try to lay off the coffee.

### 0781 Filming a TV Show or Movie

Martin: Okay, quiet on the set! What are the extras doing over there? They’re not in the scene.

Stephanie: Sorry, I’ll get them off the set. Is this the lighting you wanted for this scene? If not, I can tell the lighting crew.

Martin: The lighting is fine, but this staging is all wrong. And can somebody turn off those sound effects? We’re not using them in this scene.

Stephanie: I’ll get right on that.

Martin: Where is the cast?

Stephanie: They’re on break because they thought we wouldn’t resume shooting until 2:00.

Martin: That’s great! I have no cast, the sets are all wrong, I have extras milling around where they shouldn’t be, and where is my script?

Stephanie: It’s right here on your chair. Are you sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?

Martin: I wish I had that luxury. Time is money and we’re already way over budget. I’ll be lucky if I still have the shirt on my back when this production is over!

### 0782 Expressing Bitter Feelings

Laurent: I’m done with women! They’re liars and manipulators.

Julie: Let me guess. You’ve had a bad breakup?

Laurent: It wasn’t just bad. It was monumentally awful. I’m never going to date again.

Julie: You’re just feeling bitter right now, but you’ll get over it. You won’t always feel so jaded. Wait a second. Did you break up with Brittany?

Laurent: Yeah, I’ve told you about her before.

Julie: I remember. Don’t you guys have an on-again, off-again relationship? I mean haven’t you guys broken up before?

Laurent: Yeah, but this was the absolute end. We’re not getting back together.

Julie: But didn’t you say that three months ago? Maybe there’s still a chance for reconciliation.

Laurent: Absolutely not! Brittany walked all over me and didn’t care one iota about my feelings. I’ll never talk to her again. As far as I’m concerned, she’s persona non grata!

[Phone rings]

Julie: Hello. Oh hi, Brittany. Yes, he’s here. It’s Brittany and she wants to talk to you. Do you want to talk to her?

Laurent: Yes…no…yes! Oh, give me that phone!

### 0783 Different Political Philosophies

Carla: Our government should do more to help people who can’t find jobs.

Adam: Be careful. You’re starting to sound like a socialist. Haven’t you always said that you’re a staunch capitalist?

Carla: Of course, I’m a capitalist, but that doesn’t mean I think the government should be completely hands-off. We pay taxes and the government has a responsibility to take care of its citizens.

Adam: Ooo, now you’re sounding like a communist. Next thing I know, you’ll be calling for a revolution.

Carla: I’m serious. I think the government should help people find jobs and pay for their living expenses until they get back on their feet.

Adam: Okay, but in a capitalistic society, you’re subject to market forces. If people aren’t buying, businesses aren’t producing or providing services. That puts people out of work. Do you think the government should intervene?

Carla: I just think the government should do more, that’s all.

Adam: Okay, but that would mean higher taxes.

Carla: Yes, we should tax the rich, the more the better.

Adam: Aren’t you among the top 10 percent of income earners?

Carla: I mean they should tax the one percent!

Adam: Pass the buck, you mean.

Carla: No, I mean we need better distribution of wealth. Are you with me or against me?

Adam: That depends on when you’re planning to start the revolution, comrade.

### 0784 Socializing With Clients

Georgia: Do you know what the best part is of my new promotion? The expense account! I can’t wait to wine and dine our clients.

Dan: The purpose of the expense account is to win over new clients and to keep our current clients happy. It’s not a personal slush fund, you know.

Georgia: I know. The point is to network and to build client relationships – blah-blah-blah.

Dan: Schmoozing is part of our job and it’s not something to be taken lightly.

Georgia: Of course not. But I’m looking forward to attending charity events to rub elbows with the business elite. Free food, free booze, and free entertainment. What more could I ask for?

Dan: Talk to me in three months after you’ve had a few too many plates of rubber chicken!

### 0785 Consulting a Pharmacist

Pharmacist: Can I help you?

Sanaz: Yes, I had some questions for the pharmacist.

Pharmacist: I’m the pharmacist. How can I help you?

Sanaz: Can I fill these prescriptions here?

Pharmacist: Yes, you can. Just give those to the pharmacy technician and she’ll take care of you.

Sanaz: The reason I ask is that I’m hoping there’s a home remedy for my problems so I don’t have to pay for prescription medication.

Pharmacist: If you’ve already seen a doctor, then I would follow his or her instructions on what to do, including taking these medications.

Sanaz: All right, but I have some other problems.

Pharmacist: Like what?

Sanaz: I have a rash on my arm. See? Is there an over-the-counter medication I can use?

Pharmacist: That doesn’t look too serious. You can find medications for rashes on aisle three. I would recommend a cream made by McQ Pharmaceuticals. Use it for a few days and monitor it to see if it improves. If not, you may want to see your doctor about it.

Sanaz: Okay, thanks. I also have allergies.

Pharmacist: There are several drugstore medications for allergies.

Sanaz: I already take those. What I want to know is if there is something I can do about the headaches I get from the allergies?

Pharmacist: Pain relievers are on aisle four. Let me show you where they are.

Sanaz: Oh, thank you. On the way there, I’ll tell you about my other health problems. I need eye drops for my dry eyes, pills for my insomnia, something for my back pain…

### 0786 Going to a Bar

I’d been complaining to a coworker, Amy, about having to move to the burbs for my job. She said that there were plenty of things to do outside of the city and invited me to a bar she likes.

…

Amy: Hey, there you are.

Mykhailo: Hey, so this is the famous McQ’s you’ve been talking about.

Amy: This is it. What would you like to drink? There are several beers on tap and pretty good well drinks.

Mykhailo: I think I’ll get a couple of shots.

Amy: On a Wednesday night? You guys do party hard in the city.

Mykhailo: I’ve had a really rough week and I welcome any excuse to let my hair down. That said, I won’t be getting stinking drunk on a school night. You were right. This place is nice. It even has a dance floor.

Amy: On the weekends, there’s a live band or a DJ, although there’s also a cover charge on Fridays and Saturdays.

Mykhailo: So you do know how to party in the burbs.

Amy: Didn’t I tell you?

Mykhailo: But for me to get a thorough impression of the burbs, I’ll have to come here to check it out this weekend. What are you doing Saturday night?

Amy: Actually, I plan on coming here.

Mykhailo: Want some company?

### 0787 Speaking to a Baby or Young Child

My sister had to go out of town for a couple of days and I offered to look after her 18-month-old twins. It wasn’t long before I realized that I was over my head!

…

Colleen: Okay, you two, it’s time to go beddy-bye.

Baby: No!

Colleen: Yes, let’s get your jammies on. You can keep your binkie for now. Your blankie is already in your bed and it’s time to go night-night.

Baby: Potty!

Colleen: Okay, once you have your jammies on, we’ll go potty. What’s the matter, Mark?

Baby: Owie!

Colleen: You have an owie? Where? In your tummy? Oh, you have a boo-boo on your finger. No, don’t stick your wet finger in your brother’s ear. That’s icky. Wait one teensy-weensy minute and I’ll put a band-aid on it.

Baby: Whee!

Colleen: Michael, you can’t jump off the chair like that. That’s a no-no. Oopsie-daisy!

Baby: Waaaaa!

…

Michael had learned his lesson and so had I!

### 0788 Being Conservative and Daring

Wendy: I really don’t think Monty is the right person for this project. He’s too conservative in his thinking. We need someone who’s a risk taker.

Burt: Monty will get the job done. That’s the most important thing.

Wendy: Not if the finished product is staid and boring. Our client won’t be happy with that.

Burt: Okay, who do you have in mind?

Wendy: I was thinking of giving the project to Lorenzo.

Burt: Lorenzo? Well, he certainly likes to push the envelope, but he’s also a loose cannon. Sometimes his ideas pan out and sometimes they fall flat.

Wendy: But Lorenzo is bold and daring. Did you see what he did on his last project? It was genius!

Burt: It was reckless. It was only through sheer luck that everything worked out. I know that Monty’s ideas are more conventional and low-key, but they’re also tried-and-true. But, in the end, it’s your call.

Wendy: In that case, I’m going with Lorenzo. I’m sure he’ll do a great job.

Burt: I hope so. I wouldn’t want us to end up with egg on our face.

### 0789 Taking Care of Pets

Magda: Oooh, he’s so cute. When did you get him?

Tony: Yesterday. I’m training him to do tricks.

Magda: Really? Are you having any luck?

Tony: No, not yet. So far, he just lies there, but maybe he’s hungry and doesn’t have any energy to play. I’m going to feed him a few treats and give him some water in his bowl.

Magda: Uh, okay.

Tony: And then later, I’m going to take him for a walk. Here are the new collar and leash I bought for him. I’ll be sure to bring his carrier in case he gets too tired to walk.

Magda: Whatever you say. Are you sure you need to do all that?

Tony: Oh, sure. It’s important to keep pets healthy and happy, don’t you think? I’m going to groom him later. I wouldn’t want him to get fleas or ticks. Maybe I should take him to see the vet for a checkup.

Magda: I really don’t think that’ll be necessary. Tony, you do know that that’s a pet rock, right?

Tony: Yeah, what’s your point?

### 0790 Giving Birth to Twins

Jerome: Congratulations! I just heard that you’re pregnant with twins.

Paula: Thanks. We’re very excited, although I’m a little worried about a multiple birth.

Jerome: I come from a long line of multiple births. My father is an identical twin and he had cousins who are fraternal twins.

Paula: I see what you mean.

Jerome: That’s not even the half of it. My maternal grandmother gave birth to triplets and my aunt had quadruplets.

Paula: Wow, multiple births certainly run in your family. What about your immediate family?

Jerome: You’re not going to believe this, but my mother had octuplets. I have seven brothers and sisters the same age.

Paula: And all of you survived?

Jerome: Yup, every single one of us. We often joke that my mother didn’t have babies. She had a litter!

### 0791 Taking Photographs

Ryan: Stop mugging for the camera and stand still!

Katrina: I’ve been standing still for 10 minutes, while you’ve been setting up the shot. I have to do something. This is boring!

Ryan: I almost have the settings right. Okay, let’s try a shot. Say “cheese.”

Katrina: Cheese.

Ryan: Oh, you look washed out in that shot and it’s blurry. I think the flash came on when I didn’t want it to. You have red-eye, too. I’ll have to adjust the settings again.

Katrina: Hurry up!

Ryan: Okay, I think I’ve got it now. Get back into your pose. Lift your head a little to the side and face the sun…

Katrina: Take the picture!

Ryan: I just need to focus. There! Say “cheese” again.

Katrina: Cheese.

Ryan: Um, it’s still not perfect. Let me put the camera on a tripod. Try to stay still while I do that.

Katrina: I thought you wanted the shot to look like a candid.

Ryan: I do, but how am I supposed to make it look like a perfect candid if you keep moving out of your pose?

### 0792 Business Zoning

Sybil: Oh, this is it! This is the perfect location for our new store!

Leo: Sorry, but this space isn’t zoned for retail. It’s zoned for offices.

Sybil: But couldn’t we get the zoning commission to re-zone it?

Leo: That’s not an easy process. The city’s urban planners decided that this space would be best suited for offices. Changing their minds won’t be easy.

Sybil: I’ve heard that a lot of new developments are being zoned for mixed-use. That’s all we need to do. We just need this building to be re-zoned for mixed-use. Then, we can use the space downstairs for commercial purposes and use the upstairs space for offices or even housing.

Leo: This area was zoned for industrial purposes over 30 years ago. It took 10 years for it to be re-zoned for offices. It may take another 10 years to get it re-zoned for commercial purposes. Do you think you can wait 10 years to open your store?

Sybil: No, I guess not. What if I rented this space for an office and then ran my store out of it?

Leo: You’ll never get a business license for your store if you do that. Each type of zoning has different ordinances and the inspector won’t be fooled.

Sybil: All right. I’ll look for another space, but nothing will live up to this one.

Leo: That’s the spirit!

### 0793 Signing Professional Athletes

Nick: I don’t care what it takes. I want Robinson on my team next year.

Jamie: He’ll be a free agent and he’ll be fielding a lot of offers. I don’t know if we can make him an attractive enough deal.

Nick: We’ll offer him a signing bonus. That should sweeten the deal.

Jamie: I’m afraid that may not be enough. Don’t forget that he was a first-round pick in the draft.

Nick: Then we’ll give him a no-trade clause. With that, he’ll be calling the shots and won’t have to worry about being traded to a team he doesn’t want to be on. He should be happy with that.

Jamie: I don’t know. His agent expects a lot of competing offers. We’ll have to pull out all the stops if we want to land him.

Nick: Then we’ll do it. We won’t be bested by any other team.

Jamie: Like last year.

Nick: Last year? Don’t remind me of last year!

### 0794 Getting Over a Fight

Alisa: Don’t be mad.

Sabir: I’m not mad.

Alisa: Yes, you are. I’m sorry. I admit it was my fault. Will you stop moping now?

Sabir: I’m not moping. I’m giving you the silent treatment.

Alisa: I knew it! You’re still peeved at me. What can I do to make it up to you?

Sabir: You can leave me alone.

Alisa: If I leave you alone to stew, you’ll replay the whole incident in your head and the next thing I know, you’ll hold a grudge against me. Won’t you just forgive me so we can move on?

Sabir: What you said wasn’t just a slight. It was an out-and-out insult.

Alisa: I know it was and I’m truly sorry. I’ll buy you lunch at your favorite restaurant to show you how contrite I am.

Sabir: And you won’t say it again?

Alisa: I promise I’ll never tell you again in front of your friends how much you look like Elvis – in his later years.

### 0795 Ordering Coffee and Tea

Jermaine: I’d like a decaf drip, to go.

Drew: Would you like our light or dark roast?

Jermaine: I’ll just have whatever’s freshly brewed.

Drew: Are you sure you don’t want to try an espresso, an Americano, or a latte?

Jermaine: No, just a decaf coffee.

Drew: Sure, no problem. Would you like it hot or cold?

Jermaine: Hot, please.

Drew: Would you like any room for cream?

Jermaine: No, thanks.

Drew: Would you like some sweetener? A couple of pumps of syrup maybe?

Jermaine: No, I’ll add a couple of packets of sugar myself.

Drew: Oh, I’m sorry. I added some foam from another drink to your coffee by accident. I’ll have to start over. Did you say you wanted the light or dark roast?

Jermaine: Forget it. Let’s keep it simple. Give me a cup of tea.

Drew: Would you like that hot or cold, sweetened or unsweetened, loose leaf or in a tea bag?

### 0796 Setting Up Conference Calls and Videoconferences

Ewan: Who’s running the videoconference next week?

Petra: I am. Desmond put me in charge of it last week.

Ewan: Oh, somebody’s moving up in the world. It’s nice that he’s giving you more responsibility.

Petra: Yeah, but I’m not sure I’m ready.

Ewan: I’ve set up conference calls and videoconferences before. Maybe you can tell me what you’ve already done and I can see if you’ve missed anything.

Petra: That would be great. Okay, I’ve scheduled the meeting for 3:00…

Ewan: Stop right there. If the videoconference is at 3:00 here, it’s already 6:00 on the East Coast. That’s too late to start the meeting, don’t you think?

Petra: Oh, I didn’t factor in time zones! But I still have time to reschedule, I think, so it’s not a total catastrophe.

Ewan: Good. Be sure to initiate the call or the connection at least 10 minutes before the time of the meeting, and make sure you know how to reconnect someone if they get disconnected during the meeting.

Petra: I still need to figure that out.

Ewan: Are you facilitating the meeting, too?

Petra: I don’t know. I guess so.

Ewan: In that case, make sure you identify each person by greeting them by name.

Petra: I was hoping to lurk in the background in case something went wrong. I’d be ready to troubleshoot.

Ewan: If Desmond put you in charge of setting up the meeting, he’ll want you to take a more active part.

[Petra breathing heavily]

Ewan: What are you doing?

Petra: Hyperventilating. I don’t think I’m ready for this.

### 0797 Managing a Classroom

After three months of summer vacation, I was looking forward to the start of a new school year.

…

Okay, everybody, settle down. Take your seats and get out your textbook.

Charlie, eyes on your own book. And Kathy, do you have something to share with the rest of the class? No? Then put that away until recess.

Now, does anyone know the answer to this question I’ve written on the board? Don’t everybody speak at once. Raise your hand if you have an answer. Patrick, wait your turn. Therese raised her hand first.

Michael and Stephen, no talking in the back of the classroom. Tim, sit still and eyes forward. Pay attention. Mark, are you paying attention? I just called on you.

Duane and Frank, I don’t see you two jotting down the assignment for tomorrow.

Okay, everybody, read silently at your desks for the next 10 minutes.

…

I always forget how exhausting it is to manage a classroom full of students. How many months is it before our next summer vacation?

### 0798 Being Cautious or Thrill-Seeking

Paula: Did you get an invitation to Kip and Sheri’s wedding?

Robert: Yeah, I did. I’m still trying to wrap my head around the two of them getting married. Never in my wildest dreams would I put those two together. It boggles my mind that they’re in the least compatible.

Paula: What do you mean?

Robert: Sheri is really adventurous and definitely a thrill-seeker.

Paula: Maybe she’s mellowed over the years.

Robert: I don’t think so, and Kip is the opposite. He’s always toed the line and I don’t think he has an adventurous bone in his body.

Paula: I’ve never thought of Kip as being uptight.

Robert: No, he’s not uptight. He’s just very cautious. You’d never find him looking for an adrenaline rush or even a little novelty.

Paula: You know what they say: opposites attract.

Robert: If that’s true, then in their case, polar opposites attract!

### 0799 Dealing With the Heat

Jolene: I’m sweating like a pig. When is this heat wave going to end?

Eric: I’ve no idea, but I’m not moving a muscle until it does. Hand me that pitcher of iced tea, would you?

Jolene: Get it yourself. I’m not moving until it drops below 80 degrees.

Eric: It’s not the temperature. It’s the humidity. It’s not even the dog days of summer yet and it’s scorching outside.

Jolene: It’s scorching inside, too. Why can’t that fan move any faster? Remind me why we moved into an apartment with no air conditioner?

Eric: We couldn’t afford an apartment with an air conditioner. We were lucky to get this place.

Jolene: I don’t feel so lucky right now. My legs are stuck to this chair and I’ve sweated through my clothes.

Eric: We could buy a portable air conditioner.

Jolene: We can?

Eric: Yeah, but you’d have to get up.

Jolene: Ugh, let’s do it tomorrow.

### 0800 Advertising Jobs on the Internet

Wendy: I’ve just heard that you’re not going to use a recruitment agency to fill the new position.

Pedro: No, I’m not. There are so many Internet job boards out there that I think we can find good candidates without using headhunters.

Wendy: But headhunters do a good job of weeding out people who don’t have the right experience or qualifications.

Pedro: Yes, but they also charge a large commission. I’m going to post an ad on a few major job boards to see what happens. Most of them don’t charge a listing fee so there’s no harm in trying.

Wendy: I predict you’re going to be flooded with applications, and it’s going to take a lot of time to separate the good from the bad.

Pedro: That’s where you come in.

Wendy: What do you mean?

Pedro: You are my assistant, aren’t you?

Wendy: Yes.

Pedro: And your job is to assist me, right?

Wendy: Yes.

Pedro: Good. Roll up your sleeves and get ready for a busy week!

### 0801 Reading Online Reviews

Marisa: When we go to our favorite vacation spot in two months, let’s stay at a different hotel.

Oscar: I like the hotel we always stay at. It’s in a convenient location and we’re already familiar with it.

Marisa: That’s just it. It’s tried and true, but there’s no novelty and excitement in staying in the same place year after year.

Oscar: I don’t need novelty.

Marisa: Let’s just consider some of these other hotels I’ve been reading about. They are very highly ranked and their ratings are very good.

Oscar: You’re putting strangers’ reviews above our own experience?

Marisa: Of course not, but just look at this hotel. It received three stars out of four, and it has a lot of pros.

Oscar: Let me see that. It also has some cons, such as being noisy and pricy.

Marisa: Okay, maybe that isn’t the best example. I didn’t notice that they got dinged on those things, but let’s look at a few others.

Oscar: I’ll keep an open mind, but I’m dubious about online reviews. I take everything I read with a grain of salt. The only people who post reviews are those who love it or hate it.

Marisa: I’ll just find a hotel that everyone loves.

Oscar: And that doesn’t break the bank?

Marisa: Right.

### 0802 Talking About Movies

Martin: What did you think of that movie?

Joanna: It was okay, but I’m not really into big-budget movies with a lot of special effects and big-name stars.

Martin: Oh, you’re a film snob. I bet you only watch indie films made on a shoestring budget with low production values.

Joanna: No, that’s not true. I just don’t like crowd-pleasers that are predictable. I like movies that stretch the imagination and have some artistic value.

Martin: You mean you like those weird movies with no plot and a lot of strange characters. They’re artsy, but leave you totally confused.

Joanna: I don’t mind some ambiguity, if that’s what you mean.

Martin: Well, I’m going to see the new Spiderboy movie next week. I don’t suppose you want to come?

Joanna: Spiderboy? I’ve been looking forward to seeing that movie.

Martin: But it’s a big-budget blockbuster.

Joanna: I can’t watch artsy films all the time. Variety is the spice of life, don’t you think?

### 0803 Negotiating a Peace Treaty

Ahmed: Have you heard the news?

Menna: The nations of Palicia and Isram have signed a peace treaty. This means that there will be an immediate ceasefire and an end to hostilities. This is a historic day!

Ahmed: I never thought I’d live to see this day. Has everything been settled?

Menna: Only the most important things. The borders have been decided, there will be a recognition of statehood, and political prisoners will be exchanged.

Ahmed: That’s great, but does the treaty need to be ratified by the people of the two nations?

Menna: Yes, but the leaders have already signed the documents and the ratification process is just a formality at this point.

Ahmed: This means that refugees will be able to return home.

Menna: That’s right. They’ll be able to go home at long last.

Ahmed: This is a banner day for world peace, don’t you think?

Menna: Yes, and in that spirit, why don’t you call Hanna and invite her over for dinner? You two haven’t spoken in weeks.

Ahmed: It’s not going to be that easy. A peace treaty with my sister will require a formal apology and reparations!

### 0804 Dealing with Time Changes in Scheduling

Danny: Don’t bother looking for next year’s meeting calendar. I’m still working on it.

Tessa: What’s taking so long?

Danny: This is my first time scheduling all of the major meetings for this company and I’m getting thrown off by all of the things I have to keep in mind. For instance, our bylaws say that we have to have a management meeting every 60 days. This is a leap year, so do I have to take that into account?

Tessa: That’s a tough one. I’m not sure.

Danny: And what about daylight saving time? I have to remember when clocks will be set ahead and back.

Tessa: That’s easy. My high school teacher taught us to remember it with a simple phrase: “fall back and spring ahead.”

Danny: Okay, but that doesn’t help me with dates. Apparently, daylight saving time changes on different dates in different countries. And I have to factor in time zones to set the time for each meeting, with meeting times that work for each international office that will be participating.

Tessa: You’re right, it’s a tall order, but you do know that someone has done this before? You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

Danny: Yeah, Carl set the meeting calendar last year, but he left the company last month.

Tessa: Can’t you just take last year’s meeting calendar and fudge it?

Danny: Why do you think Carl is no longer with the company?

Tessa: Ah.

### 0805 Listening to Shock Jocks

I like listening to the radio on my morning commute each day. This morning, though, my favorite DJs weren’t on the air.

………

Howard: Do you know what happened to the Kelvin and Ben show this morning?

Robin: Kelvin and Ben are both on suspension. The FCC fined the radio station. Apparently, Kelvin and Ben said some things on the air two weeks ago that the FCC found objectionable.

Howard: That’s crazy! Kelvin and Ben are shock jocks. They’re supposed to say things that are provocative. They work in a big market producing a morning show with a lot of competition. They have to push the envelope.

Robin: That may be true, but the FCC said that they went too far. On Mother’s Day, they invited several mothers to be in-studio guests for a segment. They cursed them, said sexually explicit things, and called them obscene names.

Howard: They did that?!

Robin: I guess you weren’t listening that morning.

Howard: No, I wasn’t. Now I’m truly shocked!

### 0806 Essential and Optional Things

Ella: It’s so exciting that you’ll be spending a month studying in McQuillanland this summer. When do you start packing?

Marty: I’ve already started. The organizers of the program gave me a list of things I need to bring.

Ella: That’s really helpful.

Marty: Yeah. They say that it’s essential that I bring both warm-weather and cold-weather clothes. The weather in McQuillanland is really unpredictable.

Ella: Oh, I didn’t know that.

Marty: Yeah, and they say that it’s advisable that I bring medications for every malady I can think of because there are a lot of health dangers.

Ella: Wow, I never knew that about McQuillanland.

Marty: Me, neither. And while it’s optional, it’s also suggested that I leave all of my valuables at home. McQuillanland has a very high crime rate and visitors are often targeted.

Ella: Geez, that’s a lot to take in.

Marty: You’re telling me. And the list says that it is absolutely required that I take a self-defense course before going. You never know what to expect in McQuillanland.

Ella: You’re not having second thoughts about going, are you?

Marty: No, why?

### 0807 Getting an Unexpected Marriage Proposal

Sean: By now, I think you know how I feel about you. I’m madly in love with you and I believe in my heart of hearts that you’re my soul mate.

Ayako: That’s really sweet of you to say.

Sean: And because I feel the way I do, I would like to ask you a very important question.

Ayako: Okay, but why are you getting down on one knee?

Sean: Ayako, would you marry me?

Ayako: Marry you?! Is this a marriage proposal?

Sean: Yes, and before you say anything else, I just want you to know that I’ve given this a lot of thought and I’m convinced that we’re made for each other.

Ayako: I don’t think...

Sean: And you just have to say the word and we could elope tomorrow, if you wanted to.

Ayako: Elope?!

Sean: Or, if you prefer, we can have a lavish wedding. I’m not picky. I just want us to be husband and wife.

Ayako: Sean, you’re a really nice guy, but don’t you think you might be jumping the gun?

Sean: No. You know what they say: “When it’s right, it’s right.”

Ayako: We’ve only been on two dates!

Sean: Yes, but they have been the best two dates of my life!

### 0808 Asking for Time Off

Johnny: I just found out that the manager is letting Neal take Friday off. I asked him two days ago for Friday off and he turned me down!

Francesca: Neal’s wife is pregnant, so maybe he needs time off to go with her to a doctor’s visit, or something.

Johnny: That’s so messed up! I asked first, so I should have been given permission instead of Neal. I think the manager has it in for me.

Francesca: I don’t think that’s the case. Maybe next time, if you ask a couple of weeks in advance, he’ll say “yes.” Neal does have seniority, you know.

Johnny: Neal is always going to have seniority over me and I’m always going to get screwed.

Francesca: Don’t get a chip on your shoulder about this. Neal put in his years and earned his seniority fair and square. When you’ve worked here 18 years, you’ll get priority over newer hires.

Johnny: If I’m still in this job in 17 years, shoot me!

### 0809 A Weather Forecast

Colleen: Shh! I want to hear the weather forecast for this week.

Jerry: What’s so important about this week?

Colleen: Shh!

Radio Announcer: Tomorrow, this warm front will move out and a cold front will move in, bringing with it windy conditions with a chance of thunderstorms.

Colleen: Yeah!

Radio Announcer: On Tuesday, things will clear up in the morning and we’ll have sunny skies...

Colleen: Uh!

Radio Announcer: But it will be chilly in the afternoon and the skies will be overcast. There’ll be a chance of precipitation in the evening, with very high levels of humidity.

Colleen: Yeah!

Radio Announcer: On Friday, the temperature will drop sharply and we’ll be lucky if we reach 20 degrees.

Colleen: Oh, yeah!

Jerry: What was all that about?

Colleen: If the weather is nice this weekend, my in-laws plan to drive up to spend a few days at our house.

Jerry: [laughs] Oh, I see.

### 0810 Switching Cell Phone Plans

Paul: I need a new cell phone plan. These roaming and overage charges are killing me!

Shauna: I thought you had a good calling, messaging, and data plan.

Paul: I do, but I’m still going over each month.

Shauna: Have you thought about a prepaid plan? You’ll never be charged extra.

Paul: That’s not an option. I think I need an unlimited plan.

Shauna: Okay, but I don’t understand. Why do you have roaming charges? Doesn’t your carrier have good coverage all over the country?

Paul: I’ve been taking trips to Mexico to see my new girlfriend and the coverage doesn’t extend to Mexico.

Shauna: Oh, I see. And the overage charges?

Paul: When you’re in a long-distance relationship, you have to do a lot of calling and texting, not to mention updating social media websites to stay in touch. I keep exceeding my allotted 5000 minutes of calling time and 100 megabytes of data.

Shauna: What?! To exceed that, you’d have to be on the phone all the time!

Paul: Not all the time, but I’m talking to her now. Do you want to say “hi”?

Shauna: You’ve been on the phone with her the entire time we’ve been having this conversation?

Paul: How else can we keep up on everything that’s going on in each other’s lives?

### 0811 A Heckler at a Sports Game

Lew: Boo!! Boo!! Your team sucks!

Alexa: Sit down and stop heckling the visiting team. You’re making a fool of yourself.

Lew: I’m supporting our team. If I keep taunting the players on the other team, they may lose their concentration and we’ll gain an advantage.

Alexa: If you keep this up, we’ll get kicked out of this stadium.

Lew: We won’t get kicked out. Get into the spirit of the game and start yelling at the other team with me. Hey, it’s working! Look at that pathetic attempt to score. You guys are a bunch of babies!

Alexa: Stop that! Look, security is coming this way.

Lew: They just want to catch a glimpse of the person who has the guts to stand up for our team. Whoo! Whoo!

Alexa: If anyone asks, I don’t know you.

### 0812 Losing Employees to Other Companies

Diego: That’s three in six months!

Natalie: What’s three in six months?

Diego: That’s three of this company’s employees who have been hired away by other companies. First, there was Lamar. I wasn’t surprised that headhunters were interested in Lamar, since he was clearly a rising star.

Natalie: Yeah, Lamar was a tough loss. His unique set of skills is hard to duplicate.

Diego: You’re telling me! We haven’t been able to find a replacement. After Lamar, there was Sariah. Sariah is a classic case of brain drain. There are great jobs in McQuillanland, with lucrative pay and a low cost of living. I’m not surprised Sariah took that job.

Natalie: Sariah was very talented. We couldn’t match the offer she received and she took the better deal.

Diego: And today, Melinda tells me that she’s probably going to accept an offer from a startup that’s made her an offer she can’t refuse.

Natalie: Not Melinda, too! You know what, I think I’m finally catching on. Maybe we should be putting out feelers for better job offers ourselves.

Diego: No, not you, too! Before long, I’ll be the only one left here. I thought you’d help me talk Melinda into staying.

Natalie: No, not me. You know what they say: If you can’t beat them, join them!

### 0813 Doing Basic Exercises

Jane: I’ve just had the best workout at the gym!

Arnold: You don’t need to go to a gym to exercise. I exercise right here in my apartment.

Jane: Oh, yeah? What can you do in this small space?

Arnold: Nearly everything I need to do. Before I do my calisthenics, I stretch. And every morning I do sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups.

Jane: That’s not enough to keep you in shape.

Arnold: I’m not finished. Every other day I do lunges and squats, and I lift free weights.

Jane: But what about a cardio workout?

Arnold: I do jumping jacks, run in place, and jump rope on the balcony.

Jane: I guess you’ve got it all figured out.

Arnold: I think so. Have you seen the light? Are you going to stop going to the gym?

Jane: No way! Exercise isn’t the only reason I go to the gym, you know. I go for the view.

Arnold: I have a feeling you’re not talking about the view outside.

Jane: You’ve got that right!

### 0814 Getting Rid of Bugs and Rodents

Apartment Manager: This is the one-bedroom apartment we have for rent. Let me show you around.

Sherin: Wait! Did you see that? It looked like a mouse or a rat.

Apartment Manager: There aren’t any rodents or any other vermin in this apartment complex. I make sure of that.

Sherin: Are you sure?

Apartment Manager: Sure, I’m sure. Only last month, I bought some mousetraps and rat poison and got rid of them all. This complex is rodent-free.

Sherin: Oh, I see.

Apartment Manager: And the month before that, we had roaches, ticks, and fleas, but I fumigated and they’re gone.

Sherin: You called a pest control company?

Apartment Manager: I didn’t need a pest control company to get rid of a few bugs. I did it myself.

Sherin: Oh, okay.

Apartment Manager: And six months ago, we had bedbugs, but thanks to my diligence, they’re gone, too. So you want to see this apartment or don’t you?

Sherin: I think I’ll pass. This conversation is making my skin crawl.

### 0815 Buying Dinnerware

Wendy: We need some new dinnerware. Nearly all of our plates and bowls are cracked or chipped.

Jason: All right, you do that.

Wendy: Aren’t you going to help?

Jason: I trust your judgment. Whatever you like, I’ll like, too.

Wendy: But I need your input. For instance, this set has eight place settings: eight dinner plates, eight salad plates, eight soup bowls, and eight mugs. Everything is microwave-safe, too. What do you think of this pattern?

Jason: It’s great. Let’s get that one.

Wendy: Wait! This set is a little more formal and the plates are bigger, about an inch larger in diameter. It has a nice blue pattern, see?

Jason: Yeah, it’s perfect. Let’s buy that one.

Wendy: Oh, but look at these other options on this website. I don’t think I can decide unless I can see them in person. Let’s go.

Jason: Go where?

Wendy: To the store. I don’t want to buy something half-assed. We’ll be using these dishes for many, many years.

Jason: Like I said, I trust your judgment. Buy whatever you want.

Wendy: You’re not coming with me? Come on. What can I do to get you to come with me?

Jason: You want me to go with you shopping on my day off and while the game is on? Dream on!

### 0816 Running a Pilot Program

Rosalind: How is the pilot program coming along?

Jimmy: We’ll be ready to launch it in another month, but I have some serious reservations.

Rosalind: Like what?

Jimmy: We haven’t worked out all of the bugs yet and we might come up against some resistance from the community.

Rosalind: Isn’t that the nature of a pilot program? When you’re paving the way, you’re always going to have skeptics and dissenters.

Jimmy: You’re right, of course, but there’s a lot at stake. I just hope this trial run will win over some of those skeptics. It would be a shame to scrap this program after we’ve put in so much work.

Rosalind: After the program is launched, you’ll have six months to prove its worth, right?

Jimmy: Yeah, that’s right.

Rosalind: That’s plenty of time for the dissenters to see the light.

Jimmy: From your lips to God’s ears!

### 0817 Getting a School Class Schedule

Carlos: Did you get your class schedule?

Marianne: Yeah. You?

Carlos: Yeah. Let’s see if we have any classes together. I have PE with Mr. Lopez and social studies with Ms. Walters. How about you?

Marianne: I have PE with Ms. Schwartz and social studies with Ms. Eng. Who do you have for geography? I’m taking it with Mr. Johnson.

Carlos: I’m not taking geography this semester. Who do you have for algebra? I have Ms. Abdul.

Marianne: I’m not taking algebra. I’m taking calculus. Who do you have for chemistry?

Carlos: I’m taking biology instead. This isn’t looking good. Do we even have lunch together? I’ve been assigned the first lunch period. You?

Marianne: I have the second lunch period. How is it possible that we don’t have any classes together?

Carlos: I have an idea. Are you taking band after school?

Marianne: No, you know I’m not musical. I’m taking drama.

Carlos: Drop drama and take band. That way, we’ll at least be able to hang out after school.

Marianne: And what am I supposed to play in the band when I’m tone deaf?

Carlos: Have you ever heard of the drums?

### 0818 Placing a Drink Order

Server: Hello, I’m Allie and I’ll be your server today. Here’s a menu. Can I take your drink order?

Joel: I’d like a glass of water with no ice.

Server: Sure. Will that be sparkling or still?

Joel: Uh, tap.

Server: Okay, one glass of tap water. Would you like anything else? We have soda, iced tea, lemonade...

Joel: I’d like a Diet Coke.

Server: Sure, I’ll be right back with your drinks in just one moment.

Joel: Can you bring me a wine list?

Server: No problem. Here is your water and Diet Coke, and this is our wine list. Are you looking for any wine in particular? We have an extensive selection and some very fine house wines.

Joel: I’m looking for the kind I drink at home.

Server: What label is the wine you drink at home?

Joel: I don’t remember the name, but it has a very distinctive packaging.

Server: Oh, can you describe it?

Joel: Sure, it’s a large white box...

Server: You mean it’s a boxed wine?

Joel: Yes, that’s right.

Server: I’m sorry. We don’t have any boxed wines.

Joel: And you call yourself a restaurant?

### 0819 Athletes Behaving Badly

Connie: I just got a call from Ron’s agent. He’s in hot water again.

Walt: Not again! What did he get up to now?

Connie: He got into another fight outside of a bar, and he’s in police custody right now cooling his heels. I don’t know what he was thinking.

Walt: It’s the off-season, so I can understand him wanting to blow off some steam. But doesn’t he realize what he’s doing to his image and reputation?

Connie: They don’t call him the bad boy of basketball for nothing. I guess it’s our job to do some damage control.

Walt: Yeah, and fast. Once the press gets a hold of this, they’ll have a field day.

Connie: It’s going to be a long night.

Walt: Not as long as Ron’s.

Connie: Serves him right!

### 0820 Performing Poorly at Work

Cora: What’s up with Rob? He hasn’t been himself lately.

Doug: You’ve noticed, too, huh?

Cora: Yeah, he’s been missing work and letting things slip through the cracks. I’ve been cutting him some slack and filling in for him, but things haven’t improved.

Doug: I know what you mean. I’d never known Rob to drop the ball on anything until recently. I heard a rumor that he’s having financial problems.

Cora: No, not Rob! He has more clients than anyone around here.

Doug: Well, he’s been off his game for a while now, so some of those accounts might have gone up in smoke.

Cora: Are you going to have a talk with him? Maybe you could help.

Doug: Me? Why me?

Cora: I thought you two were pretty tight.

Doug: We’re friendly at work, but we’re not really friends. The last thing I want to do is to snoop around in his business.

Cora: But maybe he’s just waiting for a shoulder to cry on. You might be just the person to get him to bare his soul.

Doug: Spoken just like a woman! You all think we men are waiting to bare our souls and let our emotions out. Just leave Rob alone to solve his own problems.

Cora: Spoken just like a cold-hearted man!

### 0821 Eating Contaminated Food

Rachel: This tastes funny.

Sergey: It’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with it.

Rachel: It tastes like it’s tainted or something. Don’t you detect a funny metallic taste?

Sergey: No, it’s perfectly fine. Just eat it.

Rachel: I swear there’s something off about this food. I’m not eating adulterated food. There’s probably poison in here and we’re both going to die a terrible death.

Sergey: There is nothing poisonous or toxic in this food. I made it myself.

Rachel: Did you make sure that the milk wasn’t sour and that none of the ingredients were spoiled? I’ll probably die from botulism.

Sergey: There’s nothing spoiled, tainted, toxic, or poisonous in this food. Are you going to eat that or not?

Rachel: I think I’ll pass.

Sergey: Then hand it over. I’m hungry. I’ve never met such a hypochondriac before!

Rachel: I’m not a hypochondriac. I’m just a little paranoid...

### 0822 Having a Frightening Experience

Oliver: I had the most hair-raising experience of my life this past weekend.

Alena: What happened?

Oliver: You know that George bought an old house, right? Well, he’s been telling us that it’s haunted, so for a lark, a few of us decided to spend the weekend there to see if we would have any supernatural experiences.

Alena: Are you telling me that you saw ghosts?

Oliver: I’m not sure what we saw, heard, or felt. Everything was fine when we got there, but then we started hearing strange noises and I started to get goosebumps. The other guys tried to play it off, but I know they were scared, too.

Alena: What did George say about the noises?

Oliver: He laughed when he saw us jump out of our skins, and told us we were wusses. He said he heard those noises every night and they didn’t have him quaking in his boots.

Alena: Did anything else happen?

Oliver: Well, when we went to bed, the house got very cold and drafty, like there was something passing by me very closely, but I couldn’t see it. That sent me over the edge.

Alena: Has it ever occurred to you that George was playing a prank on you guys?

Oliver: A prank? It was no prank. In the middle of the night when we saw the strange faces in the windows, even George was scared stiff. By that time, all of us were petrified. It was no prank. That house is haunted.

Alena: Ooh, a real haunted house. I’d love to spend the night there, too. Do you think George would let you stay there again and let me come, too?

Oliver: You want me to go back to that house? Forget it! Wild horses couldn’t drag me within 50 miles of that place again!

### 0823 Dealing With a Bothersome Person

Melissa: I hate that guy Reuben. He’s always getting in my face.

Conan: Ooh, I sense some serious sexual tension between the two of you.

Melissa: Sexual tension? Are you out of your mind? He does nothing but give me a hard time.

Conan: That’s because he’s trying to get your attention.

Melissa: If he likes me, why doesn’t he try to get my attention by showing off, like every other guy?

Conan: Maybe he’s trying to stand out among your many admirers.

Melissa: Don’t be stupid. I don’t have a lot of admirers and I don’t want one who makes my life miserable!

Conan: Maybe if you throw him a bone, then he’ll stop his antics.

Melissa: What kind of a bone?

Conan: Ask him to the movies Saturday night.

Melissa: Me, ask him out? You’re certifiable!

Conan: I’m telling you that if you ask him out, he’ll stop pestering you.

Melissa: Putting aside the fact that I find him repulsive, if I ask him out, he’ll make me the laughingstock of this place.

Conan: I don’t think so. He’ll get what he wants and he’ll stop pestering you.

Melissa: What if it backfires and he bothers me even more?

Conan: Then you’ll get what you want – deep down!

### 0824 Grooming a Successor

Aisha: It’s only a matter of time before I retire and hand over the reins to someone else.

Javier: That won’t happen for years.

Aisha: It’ll happen sooner than you think. I’ve given a lot of thought to the person I want to fill my shoes. After long consideration, I think that person should be you.

Javier: Me? But there are a lot of people who outrank me in this organization and who have more experience.

Aisha: That may be true, but I’ve decided to make you my protégé. I’m taking you under my wing starting now to groom as my successor.

Javier: I don’t know what to say. I’m honored, of course, but aren’t you going to meet with a lot of resistance by choosing me instead of someone more senior?

Aisha: I might, but I have confidence in you. With a little time, you’ll come into your own and you’ll make a fine leader for this organization.

Javier: All I can say is thank you for having faith in me.

Aisha: The opportunity is yours and it’s up to you what you make of it.

Javier: I know that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I won’t let you down.

Aisha: I’m counting on that.

### 0825 Political Advertising

Hilary: The election is still two months away and I’m already sick of the political ads. Look at these flyers we got in the mail just today, not to mention the canvassers ringing our doorbell nonstop!

Bill: It’s worse if you watch TV, with attack ad after attack ad. It’s gotten completely out of hand.

Hilary: What happened to campaign finance reform? After years of talking about it, we still have lots of political action committees using soft money to finance media campaigns.

Bill: You can’t even call them media campaigns anymore. They’re more like smear campaigns. I’m fed up with all of this propaganda.

Hilary: You know what we should do?

Bill: What?

Hilary: We should take a vacation until the election is over…in Thailand!

### 0826 Shopping for a Used Car

Mario: Do you want to go with me to test drive a car I’m thinking of buying?

Danica: Sure. Which dealership are we going to?

Mario: I’m not buying a used car from a dealership. I’m buying it from a private party. Dealerships rip you off.

Danica: Are you sure about that? My sister bought a certified used car from a dealership and she even got a one-year warranty. She’s very happy with it.

Mario: Dealerships jack up the price. Buying from a private party means getting a better deal.

Danica: If you say so. What kind of car is it, and how much is the owner asking for it?

Mario: It’s a McQ Racer and the owner is asking 12,000 dollars, 3,000 dollars below blue book value.

Danica: That is a good price. In fact, that’s too good a price. Doesn’t that raise some red flags?

Mario: Like what?

Danica: Well, the car could be have been totaled and is now considered salvage. Its odometer could have been rolled back. It could have major mechanical problems…

Mario: You can be skeptical, but I’m not looking a gift horse in the mouth. If this guy wants to sell his car for much less than its value, who am I to ask questions?

Danica: You’ll do a title search and ask to see the pink slip before you buy it, right?

Mario: I think you’d better stay here. With you along, I see this great deal going up in smoke!

### 0827 Fad Dieting

Joel: You don’t look so hot. Are you okay?

Beatrice: I’m perfectly fine.

Joel: Oh, and you’re grouchy, too. Don’t tell me. You’re dieting again.

Beatrice: Just leave me alone. I’m not popping pills or anything like that. I’m just trying to shed a few pounds the natural way.

Joel: The natural way? You mean like that diet you were on a few months ago where you only ate Monday, Wednesday, and Friday? Or that other diet you were on before where you drank 50 cups of water a day?

Beatrice: Those were fad diets that didn’t work. I’m onto a new diet that’s guaranteed to take away those unwanted pounds and to reveal my slimmer self.

Joel: You sound like a commercial, or an infomercial. Is that where you found this diet, on some late-night infomercial?

Beatrice: It doesn’t matter where I heard about this diet. It only matters that it’s scientifically proven to help people lose weight.

Joel: All right. I need to shed a few pounds. What’s the secret diet?

Beatrice: I’m not telling you. You’ll only make fun of it.

Joel: No, I won’t. Tell me.

Beatrice: All right. I only eat orange-colored foods.

Joel: What?!

Beatrice: I said, I only eat orange-colored foods. I’ve eaten a lot of oranges and carrots.

Joel: I can see why you’re so grouchy. You’ve lost your bleeping mind!

### 0828 Important Business Contacts

Kelly: What we need are a few people in the industry to talk up our new company.

John: I’m on top of that. I’m really well connected, as you know, and I’ve already put in a few calls to a few of the movers and shakers in our business.

Kelly: I didn’t know you had such a vast network of contacts.

John: Oh, sure I do. I don’t mean to name drop, but you know Kevin Martinez at McQ Corp? I’m pretty tight with him. And Eva Arribas at Syntect? She and I go way back.

Kelly: Wow, those are some heavy hitters!

John: You’ve said it. And Kevin owes me one, and Eva would bend over backwards for me.

Kelly: It’s great! What did they say when you asked them to get the word out about us?

John: Um, I’m still waiting to hear back from them. I’m sure they’ll call back any day now.

### 0829 Having a Barbecue

George: Step aside! The king of the cookout is here. I’m ready to work my magic on this barbecue.

Sophia: Here are the burgers and hot dogs. The kids are pretty hungry.

George: Hold on. I need to put on the charcoal. Now I’m ready to fire up this barbecue. Where’s the lighter fluid?

Sophia: It’s right here.

George: Good. Oh, I almost forgot. I’ll need to gather some wood to burn to give the meat that smoky flavor.

Sophia: Why don’t I do that while you get things going?

George: No, I need to do things my way. I also need to make my world-famous barbecue sauce. The meat won’t taste very good if I don’t baste it with my special sauce each time I flip it.

Sophia: Okay, how about if I get the corn on the cob ready for grilling?

George: I’ll do that. I have my own special way of preparing the corn.

Sophia: Is there anything I can do to hurry things along?

George: Perfection takes time. Would you tell Michelangelo to hurry up?

### 0830 Donating to a Thrift Store

Scott: That’s the last bag. Help me put these into the truck. I want to get these to the thrift store before they stop taking donations for the day.

Nancy: Hold on! That bag has curtains in it.

Scott: I know they do. Those old curtains have been sitting around in the closet for 10 years. It’s time to let them go.

Nancy: But what about this bag? These are the children’s old baby clothes. You can’t just toss these! They have such sentimental value.

Scott: You’ve kept a lot of the children’s old clothes already, but we still have bags and bags of them in the attic.

Nancy: Yes, but they’re so cute.

Scott: It’s time to put aside sentiment and do some spring cleaning. After all, we’re donating them to a good cause. Families visiting the thrift store can buy them for their own children. We get a tax deduction and our items get a new life. It’s a win-win for everybody.

Nancy: I don’t know about that. What?! You’re not getting rid of those chairs, are you? They still have a lot of life in them.

Scott: Our garage is so full of old furniture that we don’t use. I’m putting my foot down. These have to go.

Nancy: But not those...

Scott: Yes, those and those and those. This is my punishment for marrying a pack rat!

### 0831 Not the Marrying Kind

Stacey: I have a date with George this Saturday. I can’t wait!

Brad: Have a good time, but you know what the word on the street is about George, don’t you?

Stacey: What?

Brad: He’s not the marrying kind.

Stacey: Oh, he just hasn’t met the right girl yet. When he does, he’ll be ready to settle down.

Brad: I don’t think so. Women who have gone out with him have told me that he’s up front with them: he has no intention of tying the knot – ever.

Stacey: Do you think he’s a commitment phobe?

Brad: I have no idea. I just know that he likes to play the field and anyone who dates him should not try to reform him.

Stacey: I wouldn’t try to reform him. I think he’ll just fall head over heels in love with me and he’ll put his philandering ways behind him.

Brad: Don’t count on it.

Stacey: I’m convinced of it.

Brad: I’m always surprised by the degree to which women can delude themselves when it comes to love!

### 0832 Creating an Online Store

Kay: I’d say we’re well on our way to establishing our new online store.

Greg: I can’t wait for this to get off the ground. Orders will pour in and we’ll make money hand over fist.

Kay: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s see where we are in our preparations.

Greg: All right. We’ve created a marketing plan that includes several ways to drive traffic to our website.

Kay: That’s great. We’ve also installed a shopping cart and a secure way to process orders.

Greg: We can use that system to track orders, right?

Kay: That’s right. All customer information will be captured and we’ll have a database of information we can mine later.

Greg: That’s great. We already have a place to house the inventory and a way to track it.

Kay: Right you are. Now all we need is one last thing.

Greg: We need to find a product to sell.

Kay: Yeah. Any ideas?

Greg: No, none. You?

Kay: Nope. But as soon as we do, we’ll be the next big thing in ecommerce.

Greg: Definitely!

### 0833 Shooting Travel Videos

Cesar: Hurry up! We’ll miss the tour bus if we don’t leave right now.

Matilda: I’m just getting some footage of this area before we leave. “This area is known for its...”

Cesar: Now what are you doing?

Matilda: I’m doing a voice-over for this segment. Voice-overs are very important in good travel videos.

Cesar: You can add the voice-over when you edit it. Let’s go!

Matilda: Just give me five more minutes. Hmm, this footage is turning out to be too shaky. Hold on while I set up the tripod.

Cesar: We don’t have time for that. Grab your camcorder, and let’s go.

Matilda: Too much motion will ruin any travel video. Wait! I want to get a close-up of that building and a wide-angle shot of this entire area. Hey, where are you going with my gear?

Cesar: I, and your gear, are going to the tour bus. I’m not going to get left behind – again!

### 0834 Breaching Computer Security

Jin: Did you hear what happened to McQ Corp?

Dina: No, what?

Jin: Hackers were able to get unauthorized access to its computer systems and cause a lot of problems over the weekend. They destroyed data and rendered the system unusable. In fact, the entire system crashed.

Dina: I hadn’t heard that. Why McQ Corp?

Jin: Well, the company announced last week that it had implemented new security measures, which made their systems impenetrable.

Dina: Ah, that explains it. Making an announcement like that is like issuing a challenge.

Jin: Yeah, it was definitely a challenge. I bet a lot hackers were trying to breach those security measures, just to show that it could be done. One of them certainly found the system’s vulnerabilities and exploited them.

Dina: What was McQ Corp thinking? They’ve had problems in the past with hackers and then they issue this challenge. I say that it serves them right!

Jin: They shouldn’t have bragged about their new security measures, but those hackers caused a lot of damage.

Dina: I bet McQ Corp learned its lesson: Don’t wave a red flag in front of a bull!

### 0835 Getting Shocking News

Karla: You look like you’ve had a shock.

Chris: Yeah, that phone call threw me for a loop. My ex-girlfriend is pregnant and she wants me to take a paternity test.

Karla: Wow, that’s quite a bombshell. Are you going to do it?

Chris: Of course. If the baby is biologically mine, I want to take responsibility for it. I wanted to start a family with my ex: get married and have children – the whole shebang. So if the baby is mine, I’ll provide child support, no question. I might even fight for custody.

Karla: Really? That’s astounding. Most guys would be hoping that the baby isn’t theirs. What did your ex-girlfriend say when you told her?

Chris: She thought I would be outraged or something. Instead, she was the one who was left stunned.

Karla: I’m surprised, too. Not many guys would want to have a child without being married.

Chris: One part of me hopes the baby isn’t mine, only because my relationship with my ex-girlfriend is over and I don’t want to rekindle it. But I’m not getting any younger and another part of me really wants to be a father.

Karla: Well, the DNA test will give you proof, one way or the other. Just cross your fingers...

Chris: I would, but I’m not sure which outcome I want more!

### 0836 Working Shifts

Lisette: You’re the new kid on the block, aren’t you?

Danny: Yeah, it’s my first day.

Lisette: I’m Lisette.

Danny: I’m Danny. Nice to meet you.

Lisette: You’re lucky to be starting on the day shift. When I started working here umpteen years ago, I had to work the graveyard shift for two years before I got the day shift.

Danny: I guess I am lucky, but I wouldn’t mind working any shift, even double shifts, once I get up to speed. My wife and I are expecting our first child and we need to save up.

Lisette: Oh, yeah? Congratulations! Well, there are always people who want time off and need someone to cover for them. You can usually pick up extra hours and shifts that way. Sometimes, there’s even overtime, but the veteran workers get first dibs.

Danny: I can understand that. Well, if you ever need anybody to cover for you, just give me a shout.

Lisette: All right, I’ll keep it in mind. Maybe I can help you save up for a diaper or two.

### 0837 Driving While Calling and Texting

Pamela: [laughs] Did you see this tweet from Sarah? She’s so funny.

Josh: Hold on. I’m texting Lance. I want to make sure he knows where we’re meeting up.

Pamela: [cell phone rings] Hello. Oh, hi Lance. Did you get Josh’s text? You didn’t? Let me IM you, bye.

Josh: I wonder why Lance didn’t get my text. I sent it from the same number I normally use.

Pamela: [cell phone rings] Hello. Jessica! Where have you been? I’ve been emailing you for three days. I thought you’d fallen off the face of the earth. What? You’ve been on vacation with your parents and you’ve been incommunicado, with no web access and no phone signal? That’s mind-blowing!

Josh: Ask Jessica whether she got my text. I’m really starting to worry about my account. Better yet, I’ll text her a photo of us right now. Say “cheese.”

Pamela: Cheese. [brakes squealing] What was that?

Josh: It’s just a reckless driver. Just change lanes.

Pamela: You change lanes. You’re the one driving.

Josh: No, I’m not. How can I be driving when I’m so busy texting?

### 0838 Talking About Immigration

Ann: The immigration policy in this country is ridiculous. Why are there so many illegal immigrants here? They cross the border and take American jobs! They all need to be deported.

Chris: A lot of immigrants have lived here nearly all their lives. Do you mean to tell me that you want to do some of the jobs that undocumented workers do, like picking crops and cleaning houses, and not earning minimum wage?

Ann: There’s nothing wrong with that kind of work. I wouldn’t want to do it myself...

Chris: That’s just it! You’re willing to benefit from cheap labor, but you keep complaining about immigrants. There needs to be an amnesty or work permit program so that they can stay legally and work.

Ann: And pay their taxes! These illegal immigrants dodge paying taxes, too.

Chris: But they don’t get the same social services that citizens or legal immigrants do. You can’t have it both ways. If you want them to do what citizens are required to do, then you have to give them legal status. And, by the way, when is your visitor’s visa up?

Ann: It was up last month, but I’m from Canada! Overstaying a visa is not the same thing as being an illegal alien.

Chris: That’s where you’re wrong. Where’s that number for immigration?

### 0839 Getting a Divorce

Nicole: I’m really sorry to hear about you and Catherine getting a divorce.

Tom: I appreciate it, but it was a long time coming. We’ve been heading toward divorce for years. I just hope it doesn’t get too messy.

Nicole: I don’t mean to pry, but didn’t the two of you have a prenup?

Tom: Yeah, but Catherine wants it set aside because our financial situation has changed so much since we got married. She also wants sole custody of Sarah, alimony, and child support.

Nicole: We live in a community property state, so that should simplify things, shouldn’t it?

Tom: You’d think so, but the distribution of property may get complicated. I’m hoping we can settle everything amicably, but I’m ready for a fight, if it turns ugly. I’ve hired Dewey Cheatum.

Nicole: Wow, you’re serious. He’s the most high-powered divorce attorney in this city.

Tom: I’m not taking any chances with my assets or my daughter. If Catherine wants to play hardball, I’m coming out swinging!

### 0840 Translating a Document

Francine: Do you know the word in Mcquish for “partnership”?

Aziz: No, I don’t speak Mcquish. What are you doing?

Francine: Jim gave me this letter and this document to translate into Mcquish because I speak a little of it, but even with a dictionary and thesaurus, it’s slow going.

Aziz: Didn’t you tell Jim that?

Francine: I did, but he still wants me to try because it’s so hard to find a Mcquish-English bilingual.

Aziz: I’m not surprised. Other than you, I don’t know anyone who speaks Mcquish.

Francine: Yeah, well, I’m doing my best to translate these documents idiomatically because the literal translation won’t make any sense, but it’s a tough job. I simply don’t know enough business Mcquish to know the equivalent words and phrases.

Aziz: Can’t you just paraphrase and convey the general meaning by using a lot of loan words and cognates?

Francine: I’m trying, but I don’t think it’s turning out the way it’s supposed to.

Aziz: At least he didn’t ask you to interpret. You’d really be in the hot seat trying to interpret in a meeting or over the phone.

Francine: Yeah, at least I was spared that experience, at least for now.

Aziz: I wish I could help you, but the only language I speak, other than English, is gibberish!

### 0841 Adopting a Child

Scott: Hi, I thought I’d stop by to pick up those chairs I wanted to borrow.

Roberta: Oh, sure. Here they are.

Scott: What are you doing?

Roberta: I’m looking through the material we got on adoption.

Scott: Are you and Robert thinking about adopting a child?

Roberta: Yeah, we are. We’ve been thinking about it for a long time, and we think we might be ready now.

Scott: Have you decided on an international or domestic adoption?

Roberta: We’re going domestic.

Scott: That means going through the foster care system, right?

Roberta: Yeah, it’s going to be a lot of work getting our house ready and all of the paperwork done. But after we pass inspection, we’ll just need to wait for a call from a social worker with a placement. We hope it’ll happen quickly.

Scott: I thought people had to wait months or years for a baby.

Roberta: They may, but we’re asking for a waiting child, maybe even one with special needs. We may even take more than one child, someone with siblings.

Scott: Wow, that’s a lot of responsibility. Wouldn’t you rather do a private adoption? Then you can call the shots and even have a closed adoption, if that’s what you want.

Roberta: We don’t mind an open adoption, actually. We’ve given it a lot of thought, and we think it’s best if the child knows who his or her birth parents are. That way, they won’t always be wondering.

Scott: I hope everything goes smoothly. I’m sure you’ll both make great parents.

Roberta: We’re not so sure, but we’ll do our best. By the way, you can keep those chairs.

Scott: Really? Why?

Roberta: You have no children and they’re a hazard. We need to childproof this house and we’re starting with those chairs.

Scott: Hey, that’s great. That big-screen TV looks dangerous. I’d be more than happy to take it off your hands, too.

Roberta: Hands off the TV!

### 0842 Taking a Standardized Test

Dad: It’s time you start preparing for the MCFL Test.

Maria: Dad, that’s 12 months away! I don’t need to start looking at test prep materials right now.

Dad: Yes, you do. Like all high-stakes testing, familiarity with the types of questions you’ll be asked will help you. You need to score well on it if you want to be admitted to a good university. The MCFL is only administered twice each year, so you’d better be prepared when the time comes.

Maria: I don’t really believe in standardized tests. Our teacher says that they don’t really measure how well you’ll do in college or in life.

Dad: It doesn’t matter what you – or your teacher – believe. Colleges consider test scores in admissions and that’s what’s important. Let’s start with some tips on answering multiple choice and true-false questions.

Maria: I know all about taking standardized tests, Dad. I’ve been taking them every year at school and I’m sick of them. Put your name here. Bubble in your answer there. I’m sick to death of those tests.

Dad: Then you’ll feel perfectly comfortable taking this one.

Maria: Why can’t they give us open-ended or essay questions? I’d do much better on those.

Dad: Bite your tongue! Those would be much more difficult to study for. Ready for question number one?

Maria: As ready as I’ll ever be.

### 0843 Passing Through Airport Security

Roland: Why are you so nervous about flying?

Natalie: I’m not nervous about being in the air. It’s going through security. I hear it’s a hassle and I don’t want to end up being strip-searched.

Roland: You won’t be strip-searched. All you need to do is to follow a few simple rules. When you get to security screening, put your carry-on bag and all metal objects in a bin so that it can go through the scanner.

Natalie: But I heard I couldn’t bring any liquids with me.

Roland: You’re only allowed three ounces of liquids, aerosols, or gels. Those should go inside a zip-top bag and be placed in a bin.

Natalie: Do I have to take off my shoes and get one of those body scans?

Roland: You don’t have to take off your shoes, but you do have to get a body scan.

Natalie: I knew it! They’re going to bombard me with harmful rays. And you wonder why I’m nervous about flying!

Roland: You won’t be bombarded with any harmful rays. You walk through the metal detector and stand in front of the scanner. It’s not dangerous.

Natalie: Oh, why do they have to treat every passenger like a potential hijacker or terrorist? Do I look like a terrorist? I feel like walking through security with my hands up saying, “I am not a terrorist. I am not a terrorist.”

Roland: I wouldn’t do that if I were you. That’s a sure way to get the TSA’s attention. Just stay calm and follow the instructions.

Natalie: Just like a lamb to the slaughter?

### 0844 Dealing With Corrupt Officials

Vera: I can’t believe that Stan has been arrested. I know that he wasn’t always on the up-and-up, but he’s being accused of influence pedaling and taking bribes.

Keigo: Stan has been getting kickbacks for years. Everybody knew that if you wanted to get what you wanted from this department, you had to grease Stan’s palms. There isn’t a more corrupt official than Stan.

Vera: But he was always so nice to me.

Keigo: That was part of the problem. He was always good to his friends and family. That’s why he’s also known for his nepotism and cronyism. He gave friends and family plum jobs with big salaries. He had an entire good old boy network.

Vera: Do you really think he’ll go to jail?

Keigo: I’m sure of it. On second thought, if he can find a judge who’s on the take and is as corrupt as he is, he has a fighting chance.

### 0845 Dropping Out of College

Aaron: Mom, I have something to tell you and you’re not going to like it.

Margo: What is it?

Aaron: I’m dropping out of college. I want to get out into the real world and get a job. I’m wasting time in school.

Margo: You’ll get a better job if you stay in school and graduate with a degree. You’ll have more earning power and better long-term prospects.

Aaron: I’m sick of school. All of my friends are earning money, buying cars, and living life. I feel like life is passing me by.

Margo: Your friends didn’t go to college and got a job right out of high school.

Aaron: That’s right. There’s nothing wrong with that.

Margo: No, there isn’t. And right now, they seem to be living the high life. They don’t have any responsibilities and can blow their paychecks on having fun. Once they have a family, their paychecks won’t stretch very far. With a degree, you’ll out-earn them right out of the gate when you graduate in two years.

Aaron: I don’t want to wait.

Margo: This is all about delayed gratification. A little suffering now will pay off in the long run. Trust me. Two more years and you’ll be done.

Aaron: Yeah, maybe I can stick it out for two more years and then no more school – ever!

Margo: Unless you decide to go to graduate school...

Aaron: Mom, don’t push it.

### 0846 Donating Blood

Michelle: Did you hurt yourself?

Gabriel: No, why?

Michelle: You have a Band-Aid on your arm.

Gabriel: Oh, that. I donated blood today.

Michelle: You did? That’s great. I’d like to donate blood, but every time I get close to a needle, I feel light-headed. I’m afraid if I go through with it, and they actually draw blood, I’ll faint.

Gabriel: I’m used to it. I give blood all the time. The needle doesn’t bother me.

Michelle: That’s very admirable. I know how important it is for hospitals to have a good supply of blood for use in transfusions.

Gabriel: I don’t mind doing it. It’s not a big deal.

Michelle: But it is a big deal. If relief organizations didn’t have enough blood when they traveled to disaster areas, they couldn’t help the injured people there. I’m sure that’s why you do it, right?

Gabriel: Well...

Michelle: Well, what?

Gabriel: There is a particularly pretty nurse who works in the bloodmobile...

Michelle: Ah.

### 0847 Experiencing a Blackout

George: Whoa, what happened?

Inga: The lights went out. Did we blow a fuse, or is this a blackout?

George: Well, I don’t see any lights on in any of the houses down the street. It’s pitch black out there.

Inga: So it’s another power outage. Somehow the circuits got overloaded again. I wonder how long we’ll have to do without electricity this time.

George: I wonder if it’s our power grid or if this is a citywide blackout. All right, we’d better light a few candles. There’s no telling how long this will last.

Inga: No, it’s not like last summer when we had rolling blackouts because of the surge in demand due to the heat. Do you remember how we passed those hours of darkness?

George: Yes, I do. What are you suggesting?

Inga: I’m just saying that there’s no reason to waste a perfectly good blackout.

### 0848 An Unscrupulous Partner

My friend Charles convinced me to go into business with him about a year ago. I wish I had had the benefit of hindsight to say “no.” I was too trusting and that was my downfall.

At first, everything was fine. We worked our butts off to get the business off the ground. But as soon as it looked like the business was going well, Charles turned on me. I had never been so deceived.

We never signed a formal partnership agreement. Since we were old friends, we relied on a verbal agreement that we would own the business 50-50. One day, out of the blue, Charles said that as the owner of the business, he had decided that my services were no longer needed. I told him he was crazy. I was co-owner and he couldn’t just fire me. He said that that was never the agreement and he was the sole owner.

And that is how I got cheated out of being co-owner of a successful business. My old friend Charles turned out to be unscrupulous. From now on, I’ll be watching my back and looking out for my own interests. No one will ever stab me in the back again!

### 0849 Bargaining With Store Owners

Connie: You speak McQuillanese. Ask the store owner the price of this vase.

Ivan: All right. He says it’s $60.

Connie: That’s actually a great price, but let’s see if I can talk him down a little. You should never accept the starting price and the prices in these stores are all negotiable. Ask him what his rock bottom price is for the vase.

Ivan: He said that he’ll take $50, but not one penny less.

Connie: The vase is really a steal at $50, but maybe he’s still willing to bargain. Tell him that I won’t pay a penny more than $40.

Ivan: I told him and he says that at that price, he’d be giving it away. I don’t think he’s going to budge. I think you should just buy it. He doesn’t look like he’s willing to haggle with you.

Connie: Don’t be impatient. Good things come to those who wait. Tell him that I’m ready to walk away if he doesn’t take $42 for it. Hey, where’s he going?

Ivan: He says that he’s walking away because he doesn’t sell to cheap Americans.

Connie: Hmph!

### 0850 Betting on Sports

Peter: Look at this! I just won 2,000 smackaroos!

Angela: Where did you get all that money?

Peter: I won it betting on the game last night. I placed a small wager with high odds and won big.

Angela: Wow, I always put money in the pools at work, but I’ve never won anything like $2,000.

Peter: I’ll introduce you to my bookie if you want to do some serious betting. But I warn you: he only deals in high-stakes wagers, not penny ante bets.

Angela: You bet through a bookie? You must do some serious gambling. I don’t think that’s for me.

Peter: You can’t win big if you don’t play big. I’ve just placed a bet on this weekend’s game.

Angela: But the Minnesota McQ’s are the favorites by a wide margin.

Peter: There’s a 10-point point spread. Come on, what do you say? Are you in or out? I’ve just put $500 on it.

Angela: That’s too rich for my blood. I think I’ll stick to the minor leagues.

### 0851 Finding a House to Buy

I’m looking to buy a house and I want a single-family home. I have been living in a townhouse for two years, and I am tired of having common walls and very small yards. My new house will have to have a lot more square footage, a large lot size, an open floor plan, great curb appeal, and lots of upgrades.

My agent has been showing me fixer-uppers, while I want a home that’s in move-in condition. The problem is, I can’t afford a high mortgage. I’m not holding out for a mansion, but I want this new house to be a step up from my townhouse.

My real estate agent tells me that I have to adjust my expectations. I asked him, “Do you mean I can’t have the house I want?” And he said, “Of course you can. All you have to do is move – to Alaska!”

### 0852 Working in a Factory

Tony: The plant manager says that you’re the new kid.

Amber: Yes, it’s my first day.

Tony: All right, you’ll be a line worker like the rest of us. Here’s your workstation. What you have to remember is that output and productivity are the most important things around here.

Amber: I understand, but...

Tony: Watch out for that forklift! You have to watch where you’re going or you’ll ruin our safety record.

Amber: Sorry. When will I get trained to use this machinery? I’ve never worked on an assembly line before to mass-produce anything.

Tony: I’m going to teach you, so pay attention. The other thing you have to worry about around here is quality control. If you don’t do things right, you’ll hear about it.

Amber: Okay, but...

Tony: Hey, sit down! As I said before, if you’re not careful, you’ll get your head taken off in this factory. Now, try to pay attention.

Amber: I’m trying, but it’s hard to do when my life is in danger every other minute.

Tony: [sighs] Rookies!

### 0853 Reading an Obituary

Ivy: This is so sad!

Stephan: What is?

Ivy: I’m reading the obituary for one of my favorite actors as a child, Mr. McBoo. He had quite a life.

Stephan: Oh, yeah?

Ivy: Yeah, and this article has really done him justice. It’s a nice tribute to a man who touched so many lives. It says here that he’s survived by his wife and five children.

Stephan: Did he live to a ripe old age?

Ivy: He was 97 when he died. There’ll be a memorial service and funeral for him this Saturday. I think I’ll send some flowers.

Stephan: Really? You didn’t know him personally, did you?

Ivy: No, but it would be nice to be part of the funeral, in some small way. I wonder who’ll be giving the eulogies. I’m sure it’ll be somebody important.

Stephan: If you say so. I’ve never heard of him. Was he on a children’s show or something?

Ivy: You’ve never heard of Mr. McBoo?! Were you raised in a cave?

Stephan: Not quite. We didn’t have a TV in the home when I was growing up.

Ivy: Oh, you poor, poor man. You’ve been deprived of Mr. McBoo all your life. Don’t worry. I’ll fix that. I have all of his shows, so we can have a viewing marathon this weekend.

Stephan: Lucky me.

### 0854 Singing Christmas Carols

Andrea: What are you doing?

Stephanie: I’m coming up with a list of Christmas carols to sing when we go caroling.

Andrea: Can I come?

Stephanie: Uh, I don’t think…

Andrea: What? You don’t think I can sing in tune?

Stephanie: No, it’s not that…

Andrea: You think I’m going to forget the lyrics?

Stephanie: No, it’s not that either…

Andrea: I know what it is. You think I’m too good. I’ll outshine the other singers. Don’t worry. I don’t mind hiding my light under a bushel, just this once.

Stephanie: Well, it’s not that either. I just don’t think you’re a good fit for our group.

Andrea: Not a good fit? I’m very knowledgeable about music and know all of the traditional carols. I’ve even composed some original ones that you might consider adding to your list.

Stephanie: I know you’re very knowledgeable about music, but in our group, it’s all about the singing voice.

Andrea: What’s wrong with my singing voice? Listen to this [sung loudly and poorly]: “Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way…”

### 0855 Learning Fire Safety

The apartment manager asked all of the tenants to come to a short meeting to learn about fire safety. I didn’t want to go, but the manager said that there would be free food, and who am I to turn down free pizza?

...

Apartment manager: Thank you all for coming to this meeting about fire safety. With the rash of fires in this neighborhood recently, it seemed like a good idea to talk about fire safety with all of you.

I want to make sure we comply with the fire code, so I’ve installed new smoke alarms or replaced the batteries in the older ones in each apartment and in the hallways. The fire escapes are in good condition and there are fire extinguishers in each hallway.

Your job is to keep the inside of your apartments safe. Keep flammable items away from the fireplace and don’t overload your electrical outlets. Any questions? If not, we’re ready for a fire drill.

...

Nobody told me there would be fire drill. I’m guess I’m ready to stop, drop, and roll – as long as I can take the pizza with me.

### 0856 Training Salespeople

Our company brought in a consultant to do sales training for our store. For some reason, we’d been getting some complaints from customers.

Consultant: My job in this training is to help your store improve its customer satisfaction, so that it can attract and retain more customers. When you interact with customers, you represent this store. It is very important that, from the get-go, customers are greeted in a friendly and positive way.

Employee: Sometimes, people are really rude. They don’t even say “hello” back.

Consultant: That may be true, but it’s still your job to make them feel welcomed. Each customer should feel that a salesperson is attentive and trying to meet their needs.

Employee: Some of them don’t even know what they want. They wander around and waste our time.

Consultant: Part of your job is to help them define their needs, offer them options, and lead them to a decision. I know that you’re not working on commission, but this is a very important part of your job.

Employee: You mean I have to hold their hand the whole time they’re in the store? Who am I, their mother?

Consultant: I can see that we have a lot of work to do. Let’s get started.

### 0857 Being Arrested by the Police

I was walking down the street minding my own business one evening when I was stopped by a police officer. After asking me a couple of questions about where I’d been, he told me to put my hands behind my back. He was going to arrest me! He handcuffed me and gave me the Miranda warning. When I asked him why he was arresting me, he said that he had probable cause to believe that I was the suspect they had been looking for in a robbery that took place on the next street.

I couldn’t believe it! I was completely innocent, but the officer didn’t want to hear it. He put me in the back of a police car and drove me to the police station. I was placed in a jail cell and, after a few hours, I was taken to a room and interrogated.

A police officer asked me question after question, and after four hours of questioning, I was finally released! I found out later that it was a case of mistaken identity. I looked very much like the suspect they were looking for and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I could sue the police department for false arrest, but I decided not to. I’d rather put the entire thing behind me and hope that I’m never that unlucky again!

### 0858 Donating an Organ

Christine: What is this sticker on your driver’s license?

Saul: This sticker? It indicates that I’ve signed up for the organ donation program. If anything bad happens to me, I want my organs to go to recipients who need them.

Christine: You mean you want somebody else to have your heart, liver...

Saul: ...eyes, kidneys, or anything else that can be transplanted into someone else. Don’t you want to donate your organs?

Christine: Me? No way. I’ll never consent to doctors cutting up my body after I die. Those organs are a part of me.

Saul: But you won’t need them when you’re dead, and there are long waiting lists at eye banks and organ registries. Your organ donation might be the difference between life and death for somebody, you know.

Christine: That might be true, but I can’t imagine somebody else walking around with my brain.

Saul: Hmm, come to think of it, me neither.

### 0859 Attending an Ex’s Wedding

Andy: What did you do last weekend?

Yuka: I went to Jamal’s wedding.

Andy: Jamal?! Your ex Jamal?

Yuka: Yes, that Jamal.

Andy: He had the nerve to invite you to his wedding?

Yuka: I actually thought it was nice of him to invite me. Whatever happened between us years ago is water under the bridge. There are no hard feelings on either side.

Andy: You told me that the breakup was mutual, but I always thought you still had a soft place in your heart for him.

Yuka: The truth is, when we first broke up, I did harbor some hopes of the two of us getting back together, but that never came to pass. We both moved on and I wish him well.

Andy: Well, how was the wedding?

Yuka: It was very nice and Jamal’s new wife seems to be a good match for him.

Andy: And you didn’t mind seeing them together?

Yuka: Not at all, especially after I met Lorenzo.

Andy: Lorenzo, huh? You’ve been holding out on me. Do tell!

### 0860 Insider Trading

Rita: I just got a hot tip from my brother to buy stock in McQ Corp.

Rick: Your brother works for McQ Corp., doesn’t he?

Rita: Yeah, he’s a director in the company, so he should know if something big is brewing.

Rick: If he’s a director and he knows something that isn’t publicly disclosed about the company, and he’s telling you to buy stock, isn’t that insider trading?

Rita: Insider trading?! I’m not a major investor. I don’t plan to buy so many shares that I’ll become a major shareholder. All I can afford are a few shares.

Rick: Still, he’d be considered a corporate insider and may be breaching his fiduciary responsibilities. Giving you this tip could get him, and you, into a lot of trouble.

Rita: Who are you, an SEC regulator? People do this kind of thing all the time, and there’s nothing shady about it. If you’re smart, you’d buy a few shares yourself.

Rick: Uh, no thanks. I don’t think I’d look good in an orange jumpsuit.

### 0861 Planning a Children’s Party

Sara: Come on! We need to buy all of the things we need for Gabriel’s party before the store closes.

Paul: Are you sure we need a party? Maybe we can just have a cake and some party hats.

Sara: Are you kidding?! We are going to pull out all the stops. We’ll have streamers, balloons, noisemakers, and party favors. This is going to be really fun.

Paul: I don’t even know if he’d like all that. What are you doing?

Sara: I’m getting lots of confetti to throw when we sing “Happy Birthday.”

Paul: The confetti is going to get all over the ice cream and the icing on the cake. And it’ll be a nightmare to clean up.

Sara: Don’t worry about the clean up. I’ll take care of that. Now, where are the goodie bags...

Paul: Are you sure all of this is necessary?

Sara: Of course, it is. Ooo...What do you think of hiring a clown and renting an inflatable castle for the party?

Paul: You do remember that Gabriel is turning one, don’t you?

Sara: So?
...

It’s just as I suspected. Some birthday parties aren’t for the children. They’re for the adults who never grew up!

### 0862 Getting a Massage

Robert: Why are you twisting your back like that?

Staci: I’m in pain. My back and shoulders really hurt. I think it’s from sitting at this computer all the time.

Robert: What you need is a good massage. It can get rid of the knots in your muscles and get you some pain relief.

Staci: I don’t know. I don’t like the idea of getting naked in front of a stranger.

Robert: If you’re skittish about that, remember that you’ll be covered with a sheet, except for the part that he or she is working on. It’s not a big deal.

Staci: But what if they’re too rough with me? It might make things worse.

Robert: An experienced massage therapist will ask you the amount of pressure you want and you can speak up if you don’t like what he or she is doing.

Staci: Do you think a massage could really help me?

Robert: Definitely. I recommend my massage therapist. She’s licensed and very good.

Staci: She doesn’t use smelly oils or play hokey music during the massage, does she?

Robert: No, she doesn’t. She’s very professional, without being too clinical, if you know what I mean. Call her!

Staci: I’ll think about it – ouch!

Robert: Call her right now. You don’t have a minute to lose!

### 0863 Limiting Free Speech

Toshi: You can’t go outside looking like that! What are you thinking?

Celeste: I’m exercising my right of free speech. I’ve put on these clothes and painted my body this way to protest the treatment of women. I want to send a message.

Toshi: You’re crazy if you think people are going to take you seriously. What you’re wearing is offensive and those messages painted on your body are hate speech.

Celeste: It’s my basic human right to a freedom of expression, and this is how I choose to express myself.

Toshi: There are limits to free speech and expression, and you’ve crossed the line. In fact, you’re abusing those rights. Obscenity and hate speech aren’t protected, you know.

Celeste: If you feel so strongly about it, I have a suggestion for you.

Toshi: What?

Celeste: You can express your free speech by protesting against me. After all, it’s your inalienable right.

Toshi: I’m not wasting my time. Hey, you’re not really going outside looking like that, are you?

Celeste: You know what they say: The medium is the message. And I’m sending my message loud and clear!

### 0864 Going to Business School

Karla: I just heard that you’re taking a leave of absence to go to business school. Is that right?

Joaquin: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it for a long time, and have finally taken the plunge. I need an MBA to get ahead in my career.

Karla: That’s great, but why don’t you go part-time?

Joaquin: I had considered taking classes on nights and weekends while I continue to work, but I’ve been admitted into an Ivy League school, and I want to take full advantage of the opportunities there.

Karla: Isn’t graduate school expensive, especially an Ivy League school?

Joaquin: Yeah, but I think it’s worth it, and I’ve been saving up. I have an undergraduate degree in accounting and finance, but that’s not enough if I want to work in the upper echelons of this or any other company.

Karla: I graduated with a degree marketing and information systems. Maybe I should be thinking about getting an MBA.

Joaquin: I’d recommend it, if you want to go further in your career. I’ll lend you all of my test prep materials for the GMAT.

Karla: The GMAT? I’d forgotten about the GMAT. That may be a deal breaker for me.

Joaquin: Why? You don’t like taking tests?

Karla: I like taking tests as much as I like getting a kick upside the head – maybe even less!

### 0865 Believing in Predictions

Armond: I hope that this new year will bring me better luck.

Patricia: You can find that out easily enough. My astrologer says...

Armond: Hold on. You consult an astrologer? You really believe in that nonsense?

Patricia: It’s not nonsense and, yes, I believe in it. I like getting predictions about the future and knowing what is in the stars for me.

Armond: Astrologers are charlatans and what they tell their customers is phony. They make it all up and tell people what they want to hear.

Patricia: I don’t know how you can say that. The horoscope for my sign each day gives me warnings and helps me avoid mistakes. And when I have big decisions to make, I go for a reading. The guidance I get is invaluable.

Armond: You’re too smart to be taken in by con artists who style themselves as mystics. It’s all smoke and mirrors.

Patricia: You’re wrong. I’ll give you an example. My horoscope today said that an unpleasant person will try to shake my beliefs. It said I should just walk away.

Armond: Hey, where are you going?

### 0866 Using Renewable Energy

Carl: Uh! What’s that smell?

Jody: I’m working on my latest invention. I’m turning our old food into an energy source for our car and our house.

Carl: Why? There are already lots of types of renewable energy that power cars and homes, and none of them smell like this!

Jody: Well, I think I’m onto a better alternative. Imagine being able to recycle your unwanted food into fuel. That’s the wave of the future.

Carl: You mean you think that it would be more efficient than wind power and solar energy? There are geothermal and hydroelectric power plants that already provide energy for lots of homes and businesses.

Jody: But I’m using food that would otherwise be wasted.

Carl: I hate to break it to you, but if you want to convert food into fuel, there are already different types of biofuels that work pretty well.

Jody: You mean somebody has already beaten me to the punch?

Carl: Yes, and I bet they’ve found a way to do it without this stench!

### 0867 Talking About Attractive Men and Women

Pamela: You know that your tongue is hanging out of your mouth, right?

David: That’s because I’ve never seen so many beautiful women in one place before. Why have I never been to this beach before? Look at her! She’s a hottie!

Pamela: Isn’t that what you said about that woman over there?

David: No, I said she’s a babe. Look at the way she sways when she walks.

Pamela: Stop ogling her or her boyfriend or husband is going to come over here.

David: I’m not ogling. I’m admiring the perfection of the female body.

Pamela: You’re undressing her with your eyes. Avert your gaze before you regret it. Oh, wow!

David: What?

Pamela: Check out that guy over there. Hello, Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome!

David: That pretty boy over there? He’s too into himself. Look at the way he’s posing so every woman on this beach can get a look at him. He’s nothing but an exhibitionist.

Pamela: And the women you’ve been ogling in the teeny tiny bikinis?

David: Those women? They’re just showing off what God gave them!

### 0868 Mergers and Acquisitions

Marisol: What do you think of the big announcement this morning?

Lamar: That our company is going to merge with McQ Corp.? From what I’ve heard through the grapevine, this isn’t a merger but a hostile takeover.

Marisol: But the CEO said this morning that our company and McQ Corp. are equals in this merger, and the integration of the two companies will be seamless.

Lamar: Don’t you believe it! McQ Corp. has a history of taking over companies with high valuations and a lot of assets and selling it off in pieces. This is no friendly acquisition.

Marisol: But what about all of that talk about our two companies consolidating into a strong business entity and creating great synergy? Didn’t you buy any of that?

Lamar: Not one word. When McQ Corp. is through with us, we’ll be lucky to still have the shirts on our backs!

### 0869 Touring Celebrity Homes and Filming Locations

Tour guide: Welcome to Hollywood Tours, everybody. I’m your tour guide for today, and I’ll be showing you some of the most memorable locations in Hollywood history. Every seat in this double-decker bus is a good one, and you’ll be able to see every landmark we drive by. Uh, do you have a question?

Elvira: Yes, I do. When do we see the celebrities? I want to get my picture taken with a real Hollywood star!

Tour guide: Well, we’ll be stopping at some celebrity homes and it’s possible that we’ll catch a glimpse of a celebrity. I’ll also be taking you to some filming locations where classic and well-known movies were filmed on location.

Elvira: Yes, but can we go to some celebrity hangouts? I really want to meet Johnny Depp.

Tour guide: I’m not sure...

Elvira: If I saw a Johnny Depp or any celebrity walking down the street, I would just go crazy! For sure I’d chase them down!

Tour guide: This isn’t a hop-on, hop-off bus and it would be really dangerous to run out into L.A. traffic.

Elvira: Oh, what’s a little danger if I can come face to face with a real life movie star?

### 0870 Using Caffeine as a Stimulant

Joan: Hi, how are you? What are you doing? What is this?

Roberto: Whoa! You’re very high-strung this morning.

Joan: Am I? I am a little wired. I’ve been up all night trying to finish an assignment for one of my classes.

Roberto: You don’t seem tired at all for having been up all night. In fact, you seem to be bouncing off the walls.

Joan: What are you trying to imply? Sorry, I didn’t mean to snap at you. I’ve been drinking a lot of coffee and energy drinks. I still have a lot of caffeine in my system.

Roberto: That’s for sure. You seem agitated from too many stimulants.

Joan: Well, I needed to stay awake, so as soon as I felt drowsy, I’d have another dose of caffeine. It gave me an instant jolt!

Roberto: But you’re done with your assignment now, right?

Joan: Yes.

Roberto: And you have a few hours before your class, so why don’t you get some sleep?

Joan: Sleep? Sleep?! I don’t know the meaning of the word!

### 0871 Listening to Club Music

Anastasia: This is the best club in the city. Grace brought me here last month. You’re going to love it.

Joshua: What?!

Anastasia: You’re going to love this club. It has the best DJ in town. She spins the best mixes.

Joshua: Did you say you’re going to get us some mixed drinks?

Anastasia: No, I said that this DJ is great. She plays music that gets people pumped up. Oh, I love this song. It samples from two of my favorite songs and it’s my favorite track on this CD.

Joshua: Did you say that you want to buy this CD?

Anastasia: No, I said I like this song. It’s got a pounding beat and I can really feel the music. I love dancing to it. Do you want to get out onto the dance floor?

Joshua: Let’s wait until she segues into something mellower. I don’t really like dancing to this kind of club music.

Anastasia: What?! You love club music? That’s great. Let’s go dance!

Joshua: I think I’ll sit this one out. Don’t you think that the volume is a little loud in here?

Anastasia: What?! You want the music to be louder? I’ll go ask the DJ to turn it up.

Joshua: No!

### 0872 A Publicity Stunt

Hank: What’s that for?

Svetlana: This costume? I’m planning a publicity stunt to get our store more business.

Hank: You think that dressing up as a giant banana will get our store more business?

Svetlana: We need to get media coverage for the grand opening of our store and attract as much attention as possible. I’ll be on hand to give sound bites and organize photo ops.

Hank: How does a giant banana tie into our store?

Svetlana: It doesn’t directly, but trust me, it’ll get noticed.

Hank: I was thinking of a traditional marketing campaign, more along the lines of holding a contest or a giveaway. And I don’t see how a giant banana is going to get media attention.

Svetlana: The person in the giant banana costume will skydive into the parking lot of the store.

Hank: What idiot have you convinced to do that?

Svetlana: Well, that’s actually why I’m here...

### 0873 Avoiding Giving an Opinion

Ariel: I know you’ll give me the inside scoop. What’s going on between Sam and Matt?

Paolo: You’re asking the wrong person.

Ariel: Don’t be like that. You know both of them really well, and I know that Sam confides in you. Don’t you think Matt is being unreasonable?

Paolo: I really couldn’t say.

Ariel: Why are you being so close-mouthed? I’m sure you have an opinion.

Paolo: I’ve never given it much thought, to be honest, and I don’t think it’s any of my business.

Ariel: But they’re both friends of yours. You must have at least speculated on what’s happening. It’s only human. Do you think Sam is going to leave Matt?

Paolo: Your guess is as good as mine. I really don’t know anything and don’t have an opinion either way!

Ariel: That’s just not possible. Okay, okay, what do you think is going on between Michaela and Carlos?

Paolo: Ugh!

### 0874 Poor Road Conditions

Alice: I’m really glad I let you talk me into going for a bike ride. It’s been years since I’ve been on a bicycle.

Sam: This is the only way to travel. You get to really see the scenery and enjoy the fresh air.

Alice: Hey, watch out! You almost dropped into that huge pothole. This asphalt is cracked and the road is all bumpy.

Sam: Thanks for the warning. Yeah, this asphalt really needs to be repaired. I’d ride on the gravel path instead, but it’s full of ruts. Oh, slow down! There’s a big dip ahead.

Alice: Whoa! I didn’t see that coming. I almost lost control on that slippery section of road. Sorry, I nearly swerved into you. Are you okay?

Sam: Yeah, I’m fine. When I suggested this route, I was sure it would be an easy ride since it’s paved all the way. I didn’t bargain for these lousy road conditions.

Alice: We’ll just have to keep our eyes open and be thankful for these crash helmets!

Sam: You won’t blame me if you go flying, will you?

Alice: Not if you break my fall.

### 0875 Shopping at the Supermarket

Stocker: Can I help you find something?

Meg: Yes, I’m looking for coffee.

Stocker: That’s on aisle 3. Let me show you where it is.

Meg: Thanks. Hmm, I don’t see the Jitters brand that I normally buy.

Stocker: It looks like we’re out of stock. We should get another shipment next week.

Meg: Okay, I’ll check back. I’m also looking for the Fructose brand soda, but I didn’t see it in the soda aisle.

Stocker: I’m afraid that’s been discontinued. Their parent company no longer makes soda.

Meg: Really? I love Fructose soda. How about the Mushy brand bread? I didn’t see it when I checked the bread aisle.

Stocker: We no longer stock the Mushy brand. There were so quality control issues at the company, so we’ve pulled all of their products from the shelves. Can I help you find anything else?

Meg: No, I guess I’ll just have to try some new brands. Oh, yes, do you carry Worm organic apples?

Stocker: We normally do, but they’re out of season right now. We won’t have any until early summer.

Meg: All of this shopping and I have nothing to show for it. I guess I’m going home empty-handed.

Stocker: We do have chocolate cakes and cookies on sale.

Meg: I’m there!

### 0876 Preparing a Professional Portfolio

Melinda: Ta da! I’m finally done with my portfolio. Do you want to see it?

Chad: Sure. This portfolio has samples of your work, right?

Melinda: It does, but it’s much more than that. It’s a presentation of the highlights of my career, with examples of my groundbreaking work.

Chad: Uh, okay, if you say so.

Melinda: Let me show you. The first page is a fact sheet of my major accomplishments, clients, jobs, and awards. That’s followed by a more detailed resume. And then, there are some samples of my best work, and finally, there are testimonials from satisfied clients.

Chad: But this is still a work in progress, right?

Melinda: What do you mean?

Chad: Well, your fact sheet is a half a page long. There are two samples of your work, and there are no testimonials, just a blank page.

Melinda: I admit that it’s a little thin right now, but what do you expect? I just started working in the field six months ago. This portfolio shows that there is room for growth.

Chad: Yeah, plenty of room.

### 0877 Cheering Someone Up

Eleanor: Isn’t it a beautiful day? The sun is shining; the birds are singing. It’s good to be alive!

Porter: Okay, Pollyanna, go spread good cheer somewhere else.

Eleanor: What’s wrong with you? You must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed.

Porter: I’m just having a bad day – no, make that a bad month. Nothing is going my way.

Eleanor: Cheer up! Every cloud has a silver lining and it’s no use crying over spilled milk.

Porter: Spare me your platitudes, and let me wallow in my own misery.

Eleanor: I can’t do that. If your work isn’t going well, then practice makes perfect. You’ll just do better next time.

Porter: It’s not my work.

Eleanor: Is it your girlfriend? If your girlfriend isn’t being nice to you then there are plenty of fish in the sea. Don’t you see? Whatever the problem is, it’s not the end of the world.

Porter: My biggest problem right now is easy to fix.

Eleanor: How?

[Door slams.]

### 0878 Recovering from an Illness or Injury

Julio: Hi, Aunt Louisa, it’s Julio.

Paula: ...And Paula. I’m on the extension in the kitchen.

Julio: Anyway, we just wanted to call and wish you a speedy recovery. Get plenty of bed rest and take it easy. Avoid greasy or spicy foods and drink lots of liquids. You don’t want to become dehydrated.

Paula: Don’t listen to him. You need to stay active and not get in the habit of sitting around. You’ll recover faster if you get up and move around a lot.

Julio: That’s terrible advice. She needs rest and to eat right. You know what they say: “Feed a cold, starve a fever.”

Paula: What does that old adage have to do with anything? What you need, Aunt Louisa, is to alternate between a heating pad and an ice pack.

Julio: What are you talking about? Aunt Louisa has a bad cold.

Paula: What?! I thought she had a sore back!

### 0879 Saying No

Liang: I have a favor to ask.

Christian: Uh oh, what is it?

Liang: I’m doing a project for my class in culinary school and I need a volunteer to taste some of my creations.

Christian: Not on your life.

Liang: But, why?

Christian: You don’t remember the last time I was your guinea pig? I was sick for two days.

Liang: That was a stroke of bad luck. Come on, please.

Christian: Count me out. No amount of pleading is going to change my mind. I bet I’m not the first person you’ve asked.

Liang: Well, no.

Christian: Who else has turned you down?

Liang: Jacob said no.

Christian: I bet he said something stronger than no.

Liang: He said that he would let me cook food for him over his dead body.

Christian: That’s what I thought. Did you ask Mele, too?

Liang: Yes, and she said she’d rather not.

Christian: Who’s next on your list of victims, I mean candidates?

Liang: You’re my last resort. If you won’t do it, then I’m sunk.

Christian: The answer is still no, but I know someone who won’t turn up his nose at your cooking.

Liang: Who?

Christian: Come here, Fido!

### 0880 Forming a Union

Norma: What is this?

Jimmy: It’s a flyer for a meeting I’ve called to talk about forming a labor union here.

Norma: Here? Do you think the management will let us?

Jimmy: They can’t stop us. We’re working longer and longer hours and we need to demand higher pay. We also need better work conditions and a say in hiring and firing procedures. All of us need to band together to have better bargaining power.

Norma: I don’t know. I want to be better paid and to have job security like everybody else, but I’m afraid of what will happen when we start agitating.

Jimmy: I’ll tell you what will happen: The management will finally hear what we have to say. With collective bargaining, the rank and file will get what we deserve, at long last. Are you in or out?

Norma: I’ll have to think about it.

Jimmy: He who hesitates is lost.

Norma: Yes, but I was always taught to look before I leap.

### 0881 Eating Genetically Modified Foods

Ralph: What’s that?

Nicky: It’s a bigger and better tomato. It’s been genetically modified.

Ralph: You’re not going to eat that, are you?

Nicky: Of course I am. I’m making a salad. Want one?

Ralph: No way. I don’t want to eat something that’s been genetically engineered in a laboratory. Who knows what kind of strange DNA it has.

Nicky: It’s perfectly safe. It’s been modified to grow faster, have more nutrients, and be resistant to disease and pests.

Ralph: And it may contain strange mutations as part of its genetic makeup that they didn’t tell you about. I really wouldn’t eat that if I were you.

Nicky: Where did you get this aversion to genetically modified foods? Scientists and farmers have always used selective breeding with animals and crops to bring you bigger and better food. This is nothing different.

Ralph: Of course it is. And just because it’s bigger, doesn’t mean it’s better. I’ll eat food that’s been modified by the only person I trust.

Nicky: Who’s that?

Ralph: Mother Nature!

### 0882 Playing a Practical Joke

Patricia: What are you doing?

Luis: I’m setting up a practical joke for Bobby. I can’t wait to see the look on his face when he walks outside and finds his bike in pieces. It’ll be the best prank ever!

Patricia: You’re not really going to take apart his bike, are you?

Luis: I’ll let you in on the joke. He’ll just be looking at spare parts. I’ve hidden his bike in the garage.

Patricia: He’s really going to freak out when he thinks that you’ve run over his bike with the car, though. I think this is more cruel than mischievous.

Luis: Lighten up! When he realizes he’s the butt of the joke, he’ll think it’s hilarious, trust me.

Patricia: Couldn’t you just play some other kind of practical joke, maybe with a whoopee cushion?

Luis: A whoopee cushion? That’s child’s play. This practical joke is worthy of a master prankster!

### 0883 Taking Care of a Willful Child

Mrs. Mason: So, how did things go?

Carl: Well...

Mrs. Mason: What’s the matter? Didn’t you and Jason have a good time while I was away?

Carl: It was interesting. He was a little willful.

Mrs. Mason: Yes, he can be a little strong-willed at times, but if you just do what he wants or give him what he wants, he’s just fine.

Carl: He wanted to eat all of the cookies and I told him no. He threw a tantrum.

Mrs. Mason: A tantrum? My son can be stubborn, but he never throws tantrums. What did he do exactly?

Carl: Well, he threw his toys against the wall, jumped the couch while shrieking at the top of his lungs, and he tried to bite my hand.

Mrs. Mason: Oh, he was just expressing his displeasure, that’s all. You don’t want children to bottle up their feelings. You should just have given him the cookies to pacify him.

Carl: Really? I didn’t want to spoil him, and eating all of those cookies wouldn’t be good for him. He seemed to have too much energy already, and he didn’t need another sugar rush.

Mrs. Mason: Next time, you should just do what he wants. He’ll grow out of this willful stage soon.

Carl: Next time?

Mrs. Mason: Yes, didn’t you say you could babysit Jason again on Saturday night?

Carl: Oh, I’d made a mistake. I have another commitment on Saturday night.

Mrs. Mason: That’s too bad. We’ll call you the next time we need a babysitter.

Carl: Sure, I can’t wait.

### 0884 Types of Meetings

Susanna: All right, then. This meeting is over. We’ll meet again next week for a status update.

Juan: Hey, do you have a few minutes to talk about tomorrow’s teleconference?

Susanna: Sorry, I’ve got to run. I’m late for my department’s weekly brainstorming session. Can it wait?

Juan: Sure, how about a lunch meeting?

Susanna: I can’t. I’m holding personnel meetings over lunch all this week. It’s the only way I can fit them in.

Juan: Okay, how about at 3:00 this afternoon?

Susanna: Sorry, I have a standing meeting with the directors once a month at that time. Can you come by after the pitch meeting at 4:30?

Juan: I wish I could, but our department head has called an emergency meeting for this afternoon to do some damage control after the shareholder meeting debacle last week. Well, how about a dinner meeting?

Susanna: Only if we can have dinner at 9:30. I won’t be finished here until then.

Juan: Do you ever get a breather?

Susanna: A breather? I think I’m due for one...in 2030.

### 0885 Talking to a Bank Teller

Bank Teller: Can I help you?

Antonio: Yes, I’d like to deposit this check.

Bank Teller: Please fill out a deposit slip and be sure to endorse the check on the back.

Antonio: Here you are. I’ve already filled out a slip and signed the check. I’d also like to cash this other check.

Bank Teller: Sure, I can help you with that. Here you are. Here’s a receipt for your deposit and I’ve cashed your check. Let me count out your $100: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

Antonio: Thanks. Could I also check my bank balance for my other account?

Bank Teller: No problem. You just have to swipe your ATM card and enter your PIN. It looks like you have a balance of $1,752. Will that be all?

Antonio: Oh, I have that much? I’d like to withdraw $80.

Bank Teller: All right. You’ll need to fill out a withdrawal slip. Why don’t you step aside while you do that so I can help the next customer, and when you’re done, come back to this window and I’ll help you.

Antonio: Okay, I’ll do that. And if I want to transfer money between accounts?

Bank Teller: You’ll need to fill out a withdrawal slip for the first account and a deposit slip for the second.

Antonio: Got it. This might take awhile.

Bank Teller: No problem, sir. We’re here all day – at least until 5:00.

### 0886 Driving Through a Speed Trap

Angel: Why are you driving at a snail’s pace?

Georgina: This is an infamous speed trap. I don’t want to get a ticket – again.

Angel: I don’t see any squad cars along the road. Are you sure this is the right stretch of road?

Georgina: I’m sure. Those cops are crafty. They hide out behind big rocks or a bend in the road, and as soon as you let your guard down and go over the speed limit, they nab you.

Angel: But you’re not exceeding the speed limit. In fact, you’re driving way under the speed limit.

Georgina: You can’t be too careful. You never know if those speed guns are accurate, and I don’t want there to be any doubt that I’m being a law-abiding citizen.

Angel: But at this pace, we could get home faster if we walked!

Georgina: Don’t exaggerate. You might be able to run home faster, but not walk.

### 0887 A Destructive Storm

Allen: Are you all right?

Monica: Yes, we’re fine, but that blizzard really caught us off guard, especially this time of year. Have you seen the news?

Allen: I just watched it. Overnight, the storm felled over 30 trees in and around the town and toppled utility lines. City officials are saying that some residents may not get their electricity restored until the weekend.

Monica: That’s terrible, especially with these unseasonably cold temperatures. I heard the ferocious storm last night, but I didn’t expect that homes would actually be in danger of washing away.

Allen: I don’t know if any will actually be washed away unless we continue to get steady rain and snow, but those downed trees wrecked plenty of homes. It’ll take months for us to fully recover from this storm.

Monica: They’re calling it “The Storm of the Century.”

Allen: Well, if we just get one of these storms this century, then that’s more than enough!

### 0888 Advertising in TV and Movies

Victoria: [clears her throat] Congratulations are in order. I just scored a product placement for our brand in the latest McQuillanator movie. Thank you, thank you very much.

Gerard: Really? That’s great! Will it have a prominent place in the movie?

Victoria: Well, you know how these things are. Our logo goes by in the blink of an eye, but millions of people are going to see it.

Gerard: So will the star be wearing our logo on his shirt or something?

Victoria: Something like that.

Gerard: But not that.

Victoria: No, it’s a little more subtle than that, but it’ll be embedded into an important scene.

Gerard: But where are they going to see it?

Victoria: Is that really important? The important thing is that our brand will be associated with a major Hollywood movie. What more could we ask for?

Gerard: Stop beating around the bush. Where in the movie will our logo appear?

Victoria: All right. It’ll be on the bottom of the star’s shoes, on the sole, and the audience will be able to see it when he’s running.

Gerard: Only if he’s running in slow motion, but he won’t be, right? If it goes by that quickly, it’ll be more like subliminal advertising.

Victoria: Exactly! I hadn’t thought of it that way, but hordes of people will be going out to buy our products and they won’t even know why. I’m even more of a genius than I thought!

### 0889 Taking Up a New Hobby

Eric: Who were you talking to on the phone?

Melissa: My mother. I was commiserating with her about Dad’s retirement.

Eric: Your father retired two months ago. That was a good thing, right?

Melissa: Well, it’s good that he doesn’t have to work anymore, but he’s driving my mother up the wall. He putters around the house and gets in her way. She retired last year, so she’s had a year to establish her new routine. He’s still kind of lost.

Eric: Why doesn’t he take up a hobby? That would give him something interesting to occupy his time.

Melissa: Believe me, my mother has tried to interest him in gardening, woodworking, and even scrapbooking, but nothing has worked.

Eric: Those sound too sedentary for somebody as active as your father. How about encouraging him to take up bird watching or golf?

Melissa: He wouldn’t be interested in those hobbies. I think he needs something more challenging, maybe playing chess or doing genealogy. Maybe he could even learn to play a musical instrument.

Eric: Maybe your Dad just needs time to find his footing again. Given time, he’ll figure out what he wants to do with his newfound free time.

Melissa: Maybe. But what does my mother do in the meantime?

Eric: She can take up a new hobby, too – out of the house!

### 0890 Enjoying Nature

Charles: This is what I call the great outdoors. Look at that stunning view!

Rachel: This is truly jaw-dropping. We’re in the middle of one of the most pristine areas of the world where wildlife lives in its natural habitat.

Charles: It’s almost like living in the middle of the wilderness, isn’t it? I bet those ponds and forests have amazing biodiversity.

Rachel: It is beautiful, and it’s great to be away from all of the pollution of the city. I’ve never seen foliage like this. This is truly a majestic landscape.

Charles: You really can’t appreciate the outdoors until you come to a place like this.

Rachel: You’re right. I feel like I’m at one with nature here.

Charles: Should we leave the hotel and go for a walk?

Rachel: A walk? Why? We have the best view of nature right here. We don’t want to spoil the effect by getting too close.

### 0891 Checking on the Status of an Application

Leo: Here’s the mail.

Denise: Did I get anything?

Leo: No, sorry. Are you expecting something?

Denise: Yeah, I’m waiting for a decision letter about my application to the McQ program. I should hear any day now.

Leo: Have you thought about calling and checking on the status?

Denise: I called last week and my application was still under review. I was told that a decision was still pending.

Leo: I’m sure it was just awaiting approval. There is no chance it’ll be rejected. You’re an ideal candidate and you’re sure to get good news in a day or two.

Denise: I hope you’re right. In the meantime, I’m on pins and needles. Every time the mail carrier walks by, my heart skips a beat.

Leo: I know this is important to you, but you’ve got to keep it in perspective. It’s not a life-or-death situation.

Denise: I am keeping it in perspective. If I don’t get into this program, it’s only the end of my career, my dream, and my future – that’s all!

### 0892 Preparing for the Busy Season

Yuko: What’s all this?

Reza: We’re gearing up for the busy season. We don’t want to get caught with our pants down like we did last season.

Yuko: Last season, we had a unusual number of visitors because of the unseasonably warm weather. We can’t expect lightening to strike twice.

Reza: We have to prepare for every contingency. If we get a flood of visitors, we need to be able to handle the surge in traffic. These three months are our peak months anyway, so we should expect an upswing in business soon.

Yuko: But what if people don’t come in large numbers as you’re anticipating? All of these extra supplies will go to waste.

Reza: No, they won’t. Most of this stuff isn’t perishable, so we’ll just save it for the next time we get a rush of visitors. Or, maybe, I’ll just invite my buddies over at the end of the season and we’ll have a party.

Yuko: So when you said that we have to plan for every contingency, this was what you meant.

Reza: Exactly!

### 0893 Sports-Related Injuries

Grace: What happened to you?!

Paul: I had a little accident at the game today.

Grace: Little accident?! You’re limping and obviously in pain!

Paul: I just pulled a muscle in my back and aggravated my runner’s knee, that’s all. It’s nothing to worry about.

Grace: And you’re still recovering from the sprained ankle, concussion, and neck strain from three weeks ago. Don’t you think you should sit out of the game for the next few weeks?

Paul: I might have to, but these aren’t serious injuries. They’re just part of playing sports.

Grace: I hate to bring this up again, but you’re not 20-years-old anymore. Maybe your ligaments, tendons, and joints aren’t what they used to be.

Paul: Don’t start with me. I’m in the prime of my life and in perfect physical condition. Don’t try to tell me I’m over the hill just because I get an injury or two now and then.

Grace: I’m not saying you’re over the hill. I just worry that you can’t sit, stand, or lay down comfortably.

Paul: Who says I can’t...ow!

### 0894 Understanding Modern Art

Stephan: What’s that?

Livia: It’s my latest artwork. It’s experimental.

Stephan: It’s, um...

Livia: Abstract. It’s part of a performance art piece I’m putting together. It’ll really challenge people’s perceptions of reality.

Stephan: I don’t really understand contemporary art. Is it supposed to represent something?

Livia: It’s my interpretation of how the rich oppress the poor.

Stephan: Really?

Livia: Yes, from a postmodern perspective.

Stephan: Oh, I see.

Livia: You do?

Stephan: No, not really. I don’t think I’m cut out for modern art. I prefer art to be representational. I just can’t wrap my head around this.

Livia: That’s the point. It’s supposed to challenge you and make you think.

Stephan: Well, it’s certainly made me think.

Livia: It has?

Stephan: Yeah, it’s made me realize that I’ve underrated paint-by-numbers all these years.

### 0895 Government Reactions to Protests

Tom: Have you seen the news?

Marianne: No, what’s happening?

Tom: People in McQuillanland are rising up against the dictator and rallying against his government.

Marianne: Wow, this is big. I thought the dictator would order a media blackout and we wouldn’t hear any news out of McQuillanland.

Tom: There is a media blackout, but people are using social media to tell the world what’s going on. Hundreds of thousands of protesters are clashing with police, and the government is having no success putting down the protests.

Marianne: Has it been violent?

Tom: It’s early days yet, but the government has already used tear gas and fired into the crowd. It’s hard to say how many people have been hurt.

Marianne: So this may be the end of tyranny in McQuillanland.

Tom: Don’t bet on it. The dictator has ruled with an iron fist and won’t hesitate to use any means necessary to stay in power.

Marianne:" Well, the protesters have a fighting chance and I’m betting that they’ll topple the government and that ruthless tyrant!

### 0896 Preparing a Speech

Lourdes: I need help.

Valery: Sure, what’s up?

Lourdes: I’m supposed to give a speech at the start of the conference next month and I don’t know what to do.

Valery: It’s not that hard to plan out a speech. You start with an attention getter using humor or telling a personal story.

Lourdes: Okay, I guess I can do that.

Valery: After that, in your introduction, you should tell the audience what your speech is about in a thesis statement. Along the way, you should establish your credibility by mentioning why you’re qualified to talk about this topic.

Lourdes: All right.

Valery: Then, in the body of your speech, you want to state your main points, using supporting ideas, giving examples, and maybe using visuals.

Lourdes: Okay.

Valery: And finally, in the conclusion, you restate your main points and make some closing remarks. Simple, right?

Lourdes: Yeah, simple. One last question.

Valery: Shoot.

Lourdes: What are you doing the morning of June 20th, and how do you feel about standing in for a coworker who plans to be deathly ill?

### 0897 Cooking a Meal

Emeril: Can you hand me that pan?

Rachel: This pot?

Emeril: No, that pan over there. I need to pan-fry these vegetables.

Rachel: Wouldn’t be healthier if we steamed the vegetables or grilled them?

Emeril: Maybe, but for this meal, I’m frying them in this pan.

Rachel: Okay, do you want me to heat this sauce in this saucepan?

Emeril: No, I’m going to microwave that right before I serve it.

Rachel: Have you considered simmering it in a saucepan to get a better consistency?

Emeril: We don’t have time for that. Slice this meat and marinade it before I broil it.

Rachel: Maybe we could bake it at a lower temperature so that the meat won’t get dried out.

Emeril: We’ll try that another time. Can you get that cutting board and chop these carrots and dice these onions?

Rachel: Sure, but don’t you think...?

Emeril: What I think is that there will be six hungry children coming through that door in an hour and I need to finish dinner. You’re here to help, right?

Rachel: Yes, of course. That’s exactly what I was trying to do.

### 0898 People of Different Ages

Gloria: I’m surprised at the variety of people on this tour.

Andy: Oh, yeah? I hadn’t noticed.

Gloria: Well, we’ll be spending the next two weeks with these people so I thought I’d get to know some of them.

Andy: That’s nice.

Gloria: Did you see that thirty-something couple with a toddler and an infant? I’m really surprised they’re on this tour.

Andy: I’m sure they know what they’re doing.

Gloria: And how about that group of seniors? Some of them look like they’re in the mid- to late-seventies.

Andy: They seem pretty spry to me.

Gloria: But what really surprises me is that group of middle-aged couples with their tween and teenage children. They’ll be a handful.

Andy: They seemed pretty well behaved to me.

Gloria: And did you notice that woman in her early-forties and the forty-ish man each traveling alone? She seemed nice, but he didn’t seem too friendly.

Andy: Maybe he’s using his time to size up everybody like you are.

Gloria: Well, I wish there were more young adults in this group. I like talking to young people.

Andy: I think there will be plenty of people for you to talk to these two weeks when you’re not sightseeing.

Gloria: Sightseeing? Oh yeah, sightseeing.

### 0899 Purchasing and Using an E-Ticket

I thought I would save time by purchasing my airline ticket online and checking in at the airport with my e-ticket. I went onto the McQ Air website and selected my flights. The screen then prompted me to pay with a credit card. After I typed in my payment information, I got a confirmation receipt with my ticket number and my itinerary. I printed out a copy of my e-ticket and I was ready to go – easy!

But when I got to the airport, it was a different story. I went up to a self-serve kiosk and swiped my credit card to bring up my account. The computer said that it couldn’t find my account. I flagged down an employee and she didn’t have any better luck, suggesting I stand in line at the check-in counter.

I got in the long line and 45 minutes later, the employee helped me check in and gave me my boarding pass. When I asked her what the problem was, she said she didn’t know and it was probably just a glitch in their computer system.

Well, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, especially if technology is involved!

### 0900 Simplifying Information

Tara: How is your presentation coming along?

Stan: It’s okay, but I’m having trouble simplifying some of the key concepts without dumbing them down too much.

Tara: I think your instincts are right. You’ll be presenting to non-specialists, so it’s important to keep your presentation clear and simple.

Stan: That’s my problem. How do I capture the essence of all of this information without making it too simplistic?

Tara: My rule of thumb is to think about which concepts really jump out at me when I think about the topic and identify any patterns in the information. Then, I build my presentations around those things.

Stan: That’s a good idea.

Tara: I would also find a non-specialist and do a run-through and get his or her feedback. That’s the best way to know if you’ve nailed it.

Stan: That’s another good idea. What do I owe you for all of this good advice?

Tara: There’s a new restaurant across the street I’ve been meaning to try for lunch...

Stan: Say no more. Lunch is on me.

Tara: Really? Let’s go right now before you change your mind!

### 0901 Participating in a Clinical Trial

Lucinda: You look tired. Are you all right?

Elan: I’m fine. It’s this clinical trial I’m enrolled in. I’m suffering from some side effects.

Lucinda: Are they serious?

Elan: No, they’re not too bad. I was told to expect some adverse reactions in the first weeks of the pilot study. I guess that’s why only a small group of volunteers is taking part right now. It’s so they can judge the drug’s effectiveness before the pharmaceutical company does a large-scale trial.

Lucinda: At least you know you’re not in the group getting a placebo.

Elan: Who knows? I hope not. If I successfully get through this first phase, I’ll get a full dose of the drug in phase two.

Lucinda: Then you may once and for all be rid of Podcaster’s Disease.

Elan: I really hope so. No one should go through life sounding like a podcaster.

### 0902 Being Chivalrous and Protective

When I first met Lance, I thought he was the perfect guy. He was a real gentleman. He opened doors for me and pulled out my chair in restaurants. He was as chivalrous as they come. But after a while, I realized that he took chivalry a little too far.

...

Lance: Let me carry that box for you.

Guinevere: No, that’s okay. It’s not heavy.

Lance: It doesn’t matter. I’m your boyfriend and I can’t have you carrying a box when my hands are free.

Guinevere: Is that some kind of code of conduct I don’t know about?

Lance: It’s how a knight would treat his lady.

Guinevere: That’s nice, but I’m perfectly capable of carrying my own box, thank you.

Lance: Don’t argue. It’s my duty to show every courtesy to my girlfriend, so give me that box.

Guinevere: Are you saying that your code of conduct takes precedence over my preferences?

Lance: No, I’m just telling you that my job is to help and protect you, even if it’s against your will.

...

How can you argue with that logic?

### 0903 Listening to a Traffic Report

Every afternoon before I leave work, I listen to the traffic report to see if I should take my usual route home or make a detour. So today, like every day, I turned on my radio.

“It’s a tough commute today if you’re traveling on I-35 north. There’s a major slowdown due to an overturned big rig that’s blocking the number two lane.”

Oh no. That meant that I had to take the 40W instead.

“If you’re traveling on the 40W, you’ll find a lot of congestion. It’s down to one lane because of a pileup. Emergency vehicles are responding.”

Wow, that meant I might have to take surface streets all the way home.

“And if you’re thinking of taking Broadway Boulevard west from downtown, think again. There is a stalled vehicle blocking the right lane and construction all the way to Main Street.”

Well, I was in a no-win situation. Do I want to spend two hours in gridlock or two more hours at work?

### 0904 Working Overseas

Danielle: I’m so excited! I just got my new posting overseas. I can’t wait to live abroad and work as an expat.

Angus: I remember my first overseas assignment. It was interesting, but the adjustment took some time.

Danielle: I won’t have any problems. I already have my work permit and vaccinations, and I speak the language fairly well. And remember, I don’t have any family to relocate.

Angus: I didn’t think I’d have any problems either, but when I got to McQuillanland, I was in culture shock.

Danielle: I’m ready for the differences in the cost of living. I’ll be getting a housing allowance, which will offset the increase in living expenses.

Angus: I wasn’t thinking so much about the expense of living abroad. I was referring to a different pace of life and the many cultural differences that affect every facet of life.

Danielle: That’s what I’m looking forward to. It’ll all be so exciting.

Angus: I’m glad you’re in euphoria right now, but be prepared for some bumps in the road.

Danielle: No problem. To me, smooth sailing would be boring!

### 0905 Getting a Marriage License

Yves: Help me fill out this application for our marriage license.

Vanessa: Can’t you do it? I’m really busy with work right now. Do as much as you can and ask me if you don’t know something.

Yves: Okay, I’ll try, but I’m reading through the requirements, and it’s a good idea for both of us to know what they are.

Vanessa: Okay, then just read them out loud to me.

Yves: All right. We need to bring identification and it’s best to bring our birth certificates, just in case. We don’t need blood tests and there’s no waiting period in this state. Are you listening?

Vanessa: To every word. Go on.

Yves: For people who have been married before, they’ll have to bring proof of divorce, death, or annulment. Okay, since you’ve been married before, you’ll need to bring a copy of your final divorce decree. Did you hear that?

Vanessa: Yeah, yeah.

Yves: We can choose any qualified officiant and the marriage license is valid for 90 days – that’s 90 days to get married and have the marriage recorded. We only have 90 days after we get the license to get married, got that?

Vanessa: Sure, 90 days. No problem.

Yves: I’m starting to wonder. If you don’t have time to fill out our marriage license application, how will you make time for our wedding?

Vanessa: What? I’m really busy right now. Let’s talk about it later.

Yves: Is it just me, or does this conversation not bode well for our future marriage?

### 0906 Using Illegal Drugs

Nancy: So, what do you think?

Ron: Uh, that was interesting.

Nancy: That’s all you have to say? I spent six months making this anti-drug film to show students in schools to try and deter illegal drug use.

Ron: Well, I’m not sure if it gets the point across.

Nancy: What do you mean? I show footage of people using hardcore drugs.

Ron: That’s just it. You start by showing people smoking pot, making the point that it’s a gateway drug, and then showing addicts popping pills, shooting up heroine, and snorting and freebasing cocaine.

Nancy: I’m trying to show the downhill spiral that results from illegal drug use.

Ron: But considering how incredibly explicit the film is, I’m afraid that teachers might mistake it for some other type of film.

Nancy: What do you mean? What type of film?

Ron: Well, instead of an anti-drug educational film, it seems more instructional. If kids didn’t know how to use illegal drugs before, they will after watching this film!

### 0907 Buying Tools at a Hardware Store

Chuck: Just remember that we have a lot to accomplish today, so let’s just get what we need and go, okay?

Ayaka: Sure, we just need a few tools for our DIY project. The power tools are over there.

Chuck: Whoa, we’re not getting power tools. We just need a few simple hand tools: a hammer, a wrench, a chisel, some pliers – and maybe an extra screwdriver or two.

Ayaka: We would get the job done so much more quickly if we had power tools. Instead of a hammer, we should get a nail gun. We also need a power drill, and hey, a sander and a table saw.

Chuck: A table saw?! We’re doing some simple repairs, not remodeling our house.

Ayaka: You never know when you need a good saw and I’ve always wanted a table saw.

Chuck: Other women want clothes and jewelry, and you want power tools?

Ayaka: That’s right. You should be counting your lucky stars!

### 0908 Being Territorial at Work

Andy: What are you doing?

Sita: I’m running some numbers for the new project.

Andy: I thought that was Delia’s turf.

Sita: She’s usually the go-to person for this type of information, but I need this info right now.

Andy: I’d be careful about stepping on Delia’s toes. She doesn’t take kindly to people encroaching on her responsibilities.

Sita: I know she can be territorial at times, but I’m sure if I explain to her why I’m getting this information right this minute, she’d understand.

Andy: Okay, but don’t be surprised if she thinks you’re trying to gain control of her little fiefdom. She’s really entrenched and she doesn’t like anyone muscling in.

Sita: Do you really think she’ll misunderstand my motives?

Andy: I wouldn’t take any chances. Hurry up and finish what you’re doing, cover your tracks, and get out. With any luck, she won’t think this is the beginning of a turf war.

### 0909 Buying Electronic Books

Kindo: What’s that?

Nookie: It’s my new e-book reader. I’m just downloading some new books onto it.

Kindo: I haven’t bought one yet. I’m old school. I still prefer a printed book.

Nookie: But if you haven’t tried it yet, how do you know you wouldn’t like it better? This e-book reader can store over 10,000 digital books and it’s easily portable. Imagine trying to carry an entire library from place to place.

Kindo: I don’t usually read 10,000 books all at once and I hear that there are a lot of incompatible formats out there. Each company is trying to edge out the others by establishing their format as the format. I think I’ll just wait until the dust settles.

Nookie: The different formats aren’t that big a deal. You can easily convert a book in one format to another.

Kindo: I like the look of text on a printed page.

Nookie: You mean that faded text on that yellowed page? On an e-book reader, you can adjust the text size, font, and even line spacing.

Kindo: Can I get all of the out-of-print books on my shelves in digital format?

Nookie: Well, I’m not sure.

Kindo: Until I can, I’ll stick to my low-tech books.

### 0910 Plagiarizing a Paper

Paul: All done.

Samantha: You’re done with your paper? How can that be? I’m just getting started.

Paul: I’m just a better student than you are.

Samantha: Let me see that. You didn’t write this.

Paul: No, I didn’t. I downloaded somebody’s paper from some website and slapped my name on it. The professor will never know. Wise up. Do you want me to find one for you?

Samantha: No way! Not only is it cheating, if you get caught, you could flunk the class or get expelled.

Paul: Don’t be such a goody two-shoes. Everybody does it. I know a guy who pays somebody in another state to write all of his papers for him and another guy who lifts his papers from old books. Don’t tell me you’ve never paraphrased ideas from a source and represented them as your own.

Samantha: Are you kidding me? Borrowing ideas from a book with proper attribution is what you’re supposed to do. You, on the other hand, are plagiarizing your way to your degree.

Paul: Damn straight! Look who’s done with his homework and who is still working on hers.

Samantha: I’d rather earn what I get and know that I didn’t shortchange myself out of an education!

### 0911 Correcting and Explaining in Conversation

Danny: You look like you need to relax.

Sybil: Excuse me?

Danny: What I mean is, you look like you could use some R and R.

Sybil: I didn’t know I looked tired and worn out.

Danny: No, what I’m trying to say is, people need leisure time once in a while.

Sybil: Yes, that’s certainly true.

Danny: The human body needs downtime to recuperate and to regenerate.

Sybil: Okay, I guess that’s true.

Danny: Let me rephrase that. People need time away from work to get ready for more work.

Sybil: Are you saying you’re planning on giving me more work?

Danny: No, no, no. Let me put it another way. It’s imperative that you don’t work this weekend.

Sybil: Why? What’s going on this weekend? Are you saying that something big is happening in the department this weekend and I’m being left out?

Danny: No, not at all. What I’m trying to say is...[sigh]...would you like to go out with me Saturday night?

Sybil: Oh, I guess I didn’t catch your drift earlier. You’re asking me out for Saturday.

Danny: Yes, I am.

Sybil: Then, I accept.

Danny: Really?

Sybil: Yes, as long as you promise never to ask me out on a first date ever again!

### 0912 Working as a Lobbyist

Cody: You’re not the kind of person I would expect to work as a lobbyist.

Jada: Why not?

Cody: I picture lobbyists as being kind of pushy and corrupt, using underhanded tactics.

Jada: It’s not like that at all, at least not for me. I just use my powers of persuasion to help my clients.

Cody: So what do you do exactly?

Jada: I meet with legislators and try to sway them to support laws that are favorable to the people and companies I represent, and to discourage them from voting for laws that aren’t.

Cody: You’re a spokesperson for your clients, then.

Jada: I’m more than that. I work for clients in the private sector and in corporations, as well as for special interest groups. I advocate for what would benefit my clients in a way that they can’t do themselves directly.

Cody: Isn’t there sometimes a conflict of interest? Let’s say your client this month wants a law passed and your client next month doesn’t. What happens then?

Jada: I’m a gun for hire. I do my best for my client, whichever that client is at that moment.

Cody: I’m glad to hear you say that. I could use the services of a good lobbyist. I’ve been trying to get my wife to agree to buy a new boat...

Jada: Stop right there. In this case there is a conflict of interest. Your wife talked to me last week and wants me to have a little talk with you about that new boat...

### 0913 Experiencing Motion Sickness

Ashley: You don’t look so good. What’s wrong?

Terrell: I felt motion sickness watching that movie. The camera jerked around and it made me dizzy.

Ashley: It didn’t bother me. The hand-held camera used to film the movie had that effect on you?

Terrell: I’m susceptible to motion sickness. You should see me on a boat. The rocking motion makes me seasick and nauseous. When I was a kid, I used to get carsick every time my family took a road trip. My parents always had a barf bag ready.

Ashley: Wow, that sucks.

Terrell: Yeah, and don’t even try to get me on an airplane. Just the starting of the engines makes me feel airsick and looking down gives me vertigo.

Ashley: So how do you travel?

Terrell: Very rarely and usually with one foot on the ground!

### 0914 Wanting Peace and Quiet

After three days of travel and meetings, I returned to my hotel room ready for some downtime. All I wanted was some peace and quiet so I could get a good night’s sleep.

...

[phone rings] Carl: Hello.

Hotel staff: Hello, Mr. Mendez. I’m calling to welcome you to our hotel. I hope you’re finding everything to your satisfaction.

Carl: Yes, yes. Everything’s fine. I just want to get some rest right now.

Hotel staff: Of course, Mr. Mendez. If there’s anything we can do for you, don’t hesitate to ask.

...

I hung up the phone and turned off the ringer. I didn’t want any more unsolicited phone calls. But then, there was a knock on the door.

...

Hotel staff: Hello, sir. I’m here to turn down your bed. May I come in?

Carl: I don’t need the bed turned down, thanks.

...

Before I closed the door, I put the do-not-disturb sign on my door. I wanted no more interruptions.

All of a sudden, a loud alarm went off. I opened my door and a hotel employee was explaining that there was a small fire in the kitchen and that the guests were being evacuated. We would have to leave the building immediately.

I left my hotel room and wondered if there was a vast conspiracy to rob me of my sleep or if I’m just the unluckiest guy in the world!

### 0915 Learning to Read Music

Mike: You have a great voice. You should join our choir.

Grace: I don’t know anything about music. I can’t even read music.

Mike: It’s not that hard. I could teach you. Look, this is a piece we’re working on right now.

Grace: What’s that weird thing at the beginning?

Mike: That’s the clef. It tells you which note each line and space on the staff represents.

Grace: Okay. What about these numbers?

Mike: That’s the time signature. It tells you how many beats are in each measure, and what kind of note gets one beat. This little number above there gives you the tempo.

Grace: Hmm, that’s kind of complicated. Why are all of these notes stacked on top of each other?

Mike: That’s to indicate a chord, with two or more notes played together at the same time. See? Musical notation is really very simple.

Grace: I don’t think I got all that.

Mike: I’m happy to help you until you get the hang of it. We could even work on some duets. We could sing harmony or I can accompany you on the piano.

Grace: I think you’re overestimating my singing ability, but I’m willing to give it a try. At least, I think I can stay on pitch. I just don’t want to embarrass myself too much.

Mike: I think you’re overestimating the quality of our community choir!

### 0916 Being Forced Out of a Position

Julianna: Ha ha! The wicked witch is dead!

Hugo: What are you talking about?

Julianna: Bettina is stepping down as chairperson of the committee. I thought this day would never come.

Hugo: That’s a big surprise. I never thought I’d live to see the day when Bettina would willingly give up her position.

Julianna: It wasn’t her choice exactly. The rest of the committee forced her out, saying they couldn’t work with her anymore. Oh how the mighty have fallen!

Hugo: But I thought she had the support of the higher-ups and they wanted her in the position.

Julianna: Well, she’s somehow fallen from grace and they can’t wait to see the back of her. It’s nice to see her get her comeuppance – finally!

Hugo: Maybe we’re not getting the full story. Maybe she had personal reasons for leaving.

Julianna: Whatever the reason, we’ll be rid of her once and for all. Hallelujah!

Hugo: How do you know the next chairperson won’t be worse?

Julianna: Bite your tongue!

### 0917 Types of Families

Patricia: Okay, we’re nearly done setting up for the neighborhood party. I got some nametags with “father,” “mother,” and “kids” printed on them, with a space for people to write their names. It’ll be easier for people to introduce themselves and make friends.

Ed: The nametags are a good idea, but we have to keep in mind that in this day and age, there are a lot of unconventional families. We won’t just have nuclear or traditional families coming.

Patricia: I don’t see how that makes a difference.

Ed: Don’t you? What if we have same-sex families? We need to be ready to hand out two “father” or two “mother” nametags. There are also a lot of stepfamilies with more than one set of parents.

Patricia: Well, the men are all “fathers” and the “women” are all mothers – that’s simple. I still don’t see the problem.

Ed: What if the children are being raised by grandparents? Some of the men could be grandfathers and some of the women grandmothers.

Patricia: Okay, we might have some of those families.

Ed: And don’t forget that some parents are divorced or are single parents. Their current partner may not be their spouse. It wouldn’t be appropriate to give them “father” or “mother” nametags. We might even get foster families, in which case, the nametags may not be applicable at all.

Patricia: I give up. Forget I ever brought up these nametags. I’ll get blank ones with nothing on them.

Ed: That’s a good idea. Given the complexity we live in today, choosing simplicity might be the way to go!

### 0918 Preparing for a Disaster

Lilly: Quick, we need to go get some supplies. I was listening to talk radio on my way home from work, and this guy was on talking about how doomsday is coming and we need to prepare.

Paul: Oh no, not this again. You have to stop listening to that garbage on the radio. Listen, there is no impending doom, and this guy was just crying wolf.

Lilly: No, he wasn’t. He had proof that the world is going to end soon and he was sounding the alarm. Those people killed in the storm last week? They were the canaries in the coal mine. Disaster is coming!

Paul: Let me be the voice of reason for a minute. How many times have you believed that the world was ending in the past few years?

Lilly: A few times, but this is for real. There’ll be a disruption of services, a run on food and water, and chaos!

Paul: Let me ask you this: if the world is ending, aren’t we all just going to die?

Lilly: Not if you have an underground bunker. Start digging!

### 0919 Visiting Childcare Centers

Adam: What’s that?

Noelle: It’s a list of questions I’m going to ask at the childcare center when we visit today. I want to be prepared.

Adam: We already know that it’s licensed and has a good reputation. What other questions are you going to ask?

Noelle: Lots. For instance, I want to know what the ratio is of children to each childcare worker and what their staff turnover rate is.

Adam: Okay, I guess those are important questions.

Noelle: And I want to know what their policies are on disciplining the kids and what kinds of meals and snacks they serve.

Adam: Also good questions.

Noelle: And I want to find out their policies on sick kids and if they allow late pick-up.

Adam: Yeah, I guess those are really good questions, too.

Noelle: And I want to know if I can observe any time I want to and if there is a secure check-in/check-out system.

Adam: Those are all good questions, but I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that you’ve done your homework.

Noelle: That’s why you married me, right? Because I’m so practical?

Adam: If that’s why I married you, wouldn’t that make me the practical one?

### 0920 Leasing Business Equipment

Olena: We need to keep pace with changing technology, but how are we going to raise capital to upgrade our equipment?

Joel: I’m not sure. Maybe we can find a supplier who will extend credit to us. We can pay in installments.

Olena: That’ll be hard to do. No one wants to extend credit these days.

Joel: I know what my brother did when his company needed new equipment.

Olena: What?

Joel: He leased it instead of buying it.

Olena: Leasing equipment? I’ve never considered it. I don’t want to end up paying more for the equipment over time than it’s worth, and still not own the equipment at the end of the contract.

Joel: The flip side is that you won’t be saddled with outdated equipment that’s hard to off-load. My brother says that there are other advantages to leasing. You can have the maintenance included in your contract, so you won’t have to worry about high repair bills.

Olena: I don’t know . . .

Joel: And my brother also told me that he was able to negotiate a purchase option. You can do the same if you really want to own the equipment.

Olena: Your brother really seems to know what he’s talking about. Why isn’t he working for me?

Joel: You have someone even better. You have an employee who listens and steals the competitors’ good ideas.

### 0921 Describing Chance and Probability

Raul: What are the chances that Rob will be here on time?

Tiffany: I’d say it’s fifty-fifty. You never know. He might surprise us and be early.

Raul: Fat chance of that happening. I’ve known him for three years, and if I had to stake my life on whether he’ll arrive early or not, I’d be in big trouble.

Tiffany: Don’t exaggerate. Rob isn’t completely irresponsible. I’d say there’s a pretty good probability that he’ll be here when he said he would, especially after he promised.

Raul: His intentions are good, but he loses track of time and doesn’t know what day it is half the time.

Tiffany: He told me that he’s trying to change.

Raul: Well, as I said, his intentions are good. He just needs to work on his follow-through.

Tiffany: Come on, he could be on his way right now.

Raul: Don’t hold your breath. I’ll believe his promises when hell freezes over.

Tiffany: Aren’t you being just a wee bit cynical?

Raul: And aren’t you just indulging in wishful thinking?

Tiffany: Hey, I think that’s him coming down the road! I think you’d better eat your words.

Raul: And I think you’d better get glasses.

### 0922 Getting a Second Opinion

Greg: Where are you going?

Anne: I’m going to see another doctor to get a second opinion. My doctor diagnosed me with a serious medical condition, and I don’t want to take it at face value.

Greg: You’re second-guessing your doctor?

Anne: No, I just want to make sure he’s right. He’s also recommending a conservative treatment for this condition, and if I really have it, I want to be more aggressive.

Greg: Doesn’t your doctor mind that you’re getting a second opinion?

Anne: No, he even gave me a recommendation for another specialist.

Greg: What’s all of that?

Anne: This is a complete set of my records along with my test results. I’m hoping he’ll have a fresh perspective when he looks at all of it and my patient history.

Greg: What are you hoping he’ll find?

Anne: The best-case scenario is that he’ll find that my doctor was wrong and that I don’t really have this condition.

Greg: If he tells you that, wouldn’t you be dubious? You’ll have one doctor telling you that you have it, and one telling you that you don’t.

Anne: Then it would be time for a third opinion.

### 0923 Having Bad Credit

Alisha: This is the second time I’ve been turned down for a credit card in a month. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

James: Have you checked your credit report recently? Maybe you have a bad credit rating.

Alisha: I have a full-time job with a good income, which they can easily verify, and I don’t have any outstanding debt, so what could be the problem?

James: Have you had a credit card before?

Alisha: Yes.

James: Did you always make your payments on time?

Alisha: Well, no.

James: Then that may be your answer. Your payment history makes a big difference with the credit bureau. If you’ve missed payments or been late, that’s a big strike against you.

Alisha: You mean if I were late a few times, I wouldn’t be able to get another credit card?

James: A few times? How many times?

Alisha: Well, maybe a lot of times.

James: And why do you need another credit card if you already have one?

Alisha: Had one, past tense. The credit card company cancelled it.

James: Aha, I think we’ve just found the crux of the problem.

### 0924 Getting Access to Important People

Camile: That is a really good idea.

Nathan: Thanks, but there’s no way I can get past all of the gatekeepers in this company to get access to the president. He’s the only one who can green-light a project like this.

Camile: Can’t you present it to your boss first?

Nathan: If I bring the idea to my immediate supervisor, she’ll either take it over or nix it.

Camile: What you need to do is to get the ear of one of his advisors and do an end run around the other managers.

Nathan: I’m not sure how I can do that. I don’t know any of the advisors in the president’s inner circle. We don’t exactly travel in the same circles, you know.

Camile: How’s your jump shot?

Nathan: Why do you ask?

Camile: My cousin works at the same gym where the company president goes to exercise. Sometimes he likes to play a game of pickup basketball, often one-on-one. If you got a call from my cousin when he’s there, you might be able to get there quickly and be in the right place at the right time.

Nathan: You mean talk business on the courts?

Camile: Sure, isn’t that how real deals get made?

Nathan: You might have an idea there.

Camile: Yes, but one piece of advice: Let him win!

### 0925 Going Through Customs

Customs Officer: Your passports, please. What is your final destination?

Özkan: Los Angeles.

Customs Officer: How long is your stay?

Özkan: We’ll be there for a week.

Customs Officer: What is the purpose of your trip?

Özkan: I’m going there on business, and my family is accompanying me on vacation.

Customs Officer: Who are you traveling with?

Özkan: This is my wife, Ayse, and these are my children, Mustafa and Ömer.

Customs Officer: Are you bringing in any restricted items? Any plants, fruits and vegetables, meats, or animals?

Özkan: No.

Customs Officer: Do you have anything to declare?

Özkan: We bought some duty-free items in the airport. Here’s the receipt.

Customs Officer: That’s fine. Step over to the exam station for baggage inspection.

...

We opened our bags for inspection, and luckily, the inspector found nothing to confiscate and we got off scot-free. I’m really glad they didn’t find that cat we’re smuggling in as a gift for my favorite podcaster!

### 0926 Getting an Advantage in Sports

Tammy: What are you doing this year to give your team an advantage?

Phillip: I have a few tricks up my sleeve. We’re going to have a winning season.

Tammy: Are you going to start Wang?

Phillip: No, I’m redshirting Wang. I want him to sit out his first year so he can sharpen his skills.

Tammy: I’m really surprised. Wang is already a great player and too good to sit on the bench.

Phillip: Trust me, I know what I’m doing. He’ll get an extra year of eligibility and be even better next year.

Tammy: If you say so. What about Schwartz?

Phillip: He’s out for the season. He’s hurt and won’t be able to play.

Tammy: That’s a major blow! He’s your star player, right?

Phillip: He’s a loss, but I have a secret weapon.

Tammy: Oh, yeah?

Phillip: This new player, Pierre, is going to give the other teams a run for their money.

Tammy: Who is he?

Phillip: Just somebody I recruited. Let’s just say he’s talented beyond his years.

Tammy: Huh? You mean he’s a ringer? You’re bringing in a ringer?

Phillip: Of course not. He’s just a little more experienced than my other players, and he’ll be a force to be reckoned with.

Tammy: Only if nobody catches on.

Phillip: Catches on to what?

### 0927 Being Tidy and Messy

Carole: It is beyond me how you and Oscar can be roommates. You’re very tidy and he’s, well, a slob.

Felix: It’s not always easy, but we’re making it work.

Carole: Isn’t Oscar really messy all the time? Whenever I see him, his clothes are rumpled and his hair is unkempt.

Felix: His room is really cluttered, but he keeps the common areas in passable condition. I do have to straighten up fairly often, and I sometimes have to pick up after him, but that’s because I’m pretty nitpicky.

Carole: That’s very tolerant of you.

Felix: Well, we have set up a system so that if things get too messy, I have some recourse.

Carole: Really, what’s your system?

Felix: Oscar and I agreed that every time he leaves a big mess, I can fine him.

Carole: That seems kind of drastic, but maybe it works for you guys.

Felix: Yeah, it keeps the place pretty clean.

Carole: Still, knowing Oscar, you must have had to fine him a lot.

Felix: Let’s just say that my next vacation will be in Monte Carlo!

### 0928 Understanding Corporate Structure

Andrea: This organizational chart is really confusing.

Raffael: Why are you looking at that?

Andrea: I have an interview next week and I’m trying to bone up on the company I’ll be interviewing with. I want to impress them, but this chart is really confusing.

Raffael: Let me see. It’s a simple flow chart. You have your board of directors at the top, with the managing director reporting to them, and then the executive officers overseeing major departments.

Andrea: But I thought managers work below the executive officers.

Raffael: You’re confusing managers with managing directors. The managing director oversees the entire company, and managers oversee daily operations.

Andrea: Oh, I see. So these here are the departments: accounting, marketing, purchasing, personnel, R & D, sales, and production.

Raffael: That’s right. Which department are you interviewing for?

Andrea: I think the job is in purchasing.

Raffael: You think? Don’t you think that’s something you should get straight before you do anything else?

Andrea: You might have a point there.

### 0929 Trying to Locate Someone

Carmen: Hi, I’m looking for Waldo. I was told that he comes in here from time to time. Have you seen him?

Antonio: Waldo? I haven’t seen him in a while. He comes in sometimes, but it’s pretty hit-and-miss.

Carmen: I can’t seem to pin him down. Every time I think I’m hot on his trail, I’m too late. He’s skipped town or has gone underground.

Antonio: That’s Waldo. He’s the most elusive person I know. I think he actually enjoys playing a game of cat and mouse with people who are trying to locate him.

Carmen: I’m starting to get that feeling. I’ve been trying to track him down for over two months.

Antonio: He does seem to have a sixth sense and knows when to vanish.

Carmen: I’m starting to think he doesn’t really exist and that he’s just a figment of my imagination.

Antonio: It’s funny you should say that. I think his ultimate goal is to be invisible, just another face in the crowd.

### 0930 Fearing Bioterrorism

Natalie: Why are you wearing that gas mask?

Anton: I’m getting used to it. If we ever have a bioterrorist attack, I’ll be ready. Want to try one on?

Natalie: No, thanks. If we get involved in biological warfare, I think we’ll have some warning.

Anton: That’s what you think. Airborne toxins, bacteria, or viruses could be in the air right now, and you and I wouldn’t be able to detect it. It could infect you in the blink of an eye.

Natalie: Then I’ll be sick or dead anyway. So who cares?

Anton: I said we wouldn’t be able to detect it, but there are agencies with early detection equipment that could. As soon as they sound the alarm, we can put on our gas masks and take other precautions.

Natalie: If we’re really attacked by bioterrorists, what good is early detection? It’s not like you can really escape the toxins.

Anton: Don’t pooh-pooh these preparations. They could be the difference between life and death when the time comes.

Natalie: Right. In the meantime, I think I’ll just get dressed – without the stylish gas mask.

### 0931 Solving a Mystery

Jane: You have to watch this movie. It’s so good!

Hercule: I’m not really into mysteries.

Jane: But this is a really good whodunit.

Hercule: I prefer action movies.

Jane: Listen, the movie gives you plenty of clues, and the detective follows hunch after hunch, lead after lead, but the movie is full of red herrings. Everybody seems to have an alibi and the witnesses aren’t reliable.

Hercule: I don’t know. It seems kind of confusing to me. I don’t really want to use my brain when I’m watching a movie.

Jane: But that’s the fun part of it. The true identity of the victim is a mystery, the suspects all have skeletons in their closets, and the detective isn’t what he seems.

Hercule: Yeah, well . . .

Jane: And just when you think you’re getting to the bottom of it, the rug gets pulled out from under you. It keeps you guessing until the very end. Hey, where are you going?

Hercule: I’m going to find an action movie where all my brain has to do is handle the sensory overload!

### 0932 Rebuilding Consumer Trust

Karen: The scandal over our new product line really damaged our image, and we need to rebuild consumer trust.

Brandon: This is going to be an uphill battle. Losing customers is easy. Winning them back will be really hard.

Karen: I agree, but our stock is taking a beating and we need to do something now.

Brandon: Part of the problem was that the rumors about the new product heightened expectations and we just fell short of the mark. We need to always remember to under promise and over deliver.

Karen: Yes, that was a big part of the problem, but we also need to have more transparency. We can’t make major changes without first getting customer input and without notifying them well in advance. Otherwise, our customers feel betrayed.

Brandon: All right, I think we have a place to begin. Should I call a general meeting to talk specifics?

Karen: Sure, and while we’re at it, we can work on employee morale, too!

### 0933 Letting Go of the Past

Emma: I think it’s time.

Uday: I beg to differ.

Emma: You can’t live in the past. I know that you like reliving your glory days, but the only way to move on is to let go of the past.

Uday: I don’t want to move on. If you’ve had the life I’ve had, you’d cling to the past, too.

Emma: But your best days are still to come. Constantly harking back to days gone by doesn’t allow you to live in the moment and to plan for the future.

Uday: So what? I have my memories to comfort me in my old age.

Emma: You’re speaking as though your life were over. You’re still young.

Uday: Not as young as I used to be.

Emma: These old trophies and football jerseys won’t keep you young.

Uday: Yes, but they help me remember some of the highlights of the old days. Did I ever tell you about the time I single-handedly won the game?

Emma: Uh . . .

### 0934 Watching Special Effects

Chrissy: Wow, that movie was amazing, but I can’t believe that they blew up the Eiffel Tower. I bet the French are really pissed.

Jack: You’re kidding, right? They didn’t really blow up the Eiffel Tower. They used special effects to make it look that way.

Chrissy: Are you sure? It really looked like the real thing.

Jack: They used a scale model or a computer-generated image of the Eiffel Tower and added some pyrotechnics or other visual effects to create what you saw on the screen. It’s like a big optical illusion. I can’t believe you really thought they blew up the Eiffel Tower.

Chrissy: Oh no, I didn’t. I was just kidding. But you have to admit that it was pretty cool that they got the real president of the United States to kill that monster, right?

Jack: You must be messing with my mind again. That wasn’t the president. That was an actor wearing prosthetics and makeup standing in front of a green screen. They added the monster later in post-production.

Chrissy: Oh, right, sure. But you have to hand it to them for moving a section of the Great Wall of China to New York City, right?

Jack: Oh, boy . . .

### 0935 Showing Signs of Age

Julian: What is that, another gray hair?! My hair is already thinning on top. I don’t need more gray hairs.

Vera: I think salt and pepper hair looks great on men. It makes them look distinguished.

Julian: It makes them look old. Thank God I don’t have a receding hairline – yet.

Vera: When you get to be my age, you won’t worry so much about graying hair. There are a lot of other things to worry about.

Julian: Like what?

Vera: Forget I mentioned it. Showing signs of age isn’t something to be lamented. It’s natural and part of maturing as a person. It gives you character.

Julian: Stop being evasive. Like what?

Vera: Okay, like wrinkles and age spots, deafness and memory loss.

Julian: Gee, thanks. If I ever need to talk someone off a ledge, I’ll give you a call!

### 0936 Working With the IT Department

Whenever I have a technology problem at work, I try to solve it myself. It’s not that I know a lot of about technology. In fact, the opposite is true. I’m pretty much a computer illiterate, but I still try.

Why do I bother? The answer is the IT department in my company. Every time I consult one of the IT specialists, they make me feel like an idiot. But this time, I had no choice but to call in the experts.

***

Leah: What seems to be the problem here?

Steve: My computer is acting up and I can’t get this file to open.

Leah: Move. Let me take a look. Ha, of course your computer is acting up. I don’t know what you did to it, but it’s really screwed up.

Steve: I’m not sure how I could have done that.

Leah: Me neither. This is configured all wrong. And the reason you can’t open this file is because it’s encrypted. Did that occur to you?

Steve: No, I guess I didn’t.

Leah: I’ll fix everything, but try not to screw it up again.

Steve: I’ll do my best.

***

See what I mean?

### 0937 Being a Stay-at-Home Dad

Gladys: Hi, Dan. I’m surprised to see you here at the supermarket in the middle of the day.

Dan: Why?

Gladys: I thought you’d be working.

Dan: I am working. I’m a stay-at-home dad and I take care of the kids while my wife goes to work.

Gladys: Oh, did you get laid off from your job?

Dan: No, my wife works full-time out of the house and I work full-time at home.

Gladys: You mean that your wife is the breadwinner and you’re a househusband?

Dan: If you want to put it that way, yes. I’m the caretaker for the kids during the day and I do the household chores.

Gladys: Oh, your wife must be a feminist.

Dan: No, my wife is just a modern woman with modern sensibilities.

Gladys: Well, I know that some families like to live radical lifestyles these days, changing up gender roles.

Dan: We don’t think of it as radical. In fact, it’s quite common nowadays.

Gladys: if you say so. Tell your wife I’d be happy to share my recipes with her when you go back to work and she’s a housewife again.

Dan: [sigh]

### 0938 Learning to Ride the Subway

Donny: Come on, we need to buy our subway tickets at that ticket machine.

Cayla: Why can’t we just get them at the ticket window? I’m not sure what the fare is.

Donny: There’s a long line and we need to catch a train right now.

Cayla: I’ve never taken the subway before. I don’t know how it works.

Donny: Just follow me. Here, take this card and walk through the turnstile. Put your card in this slot and then retrieve it as you pass through.

Cayla: Okay, now where do we go?

Donny: Let’s look at this subway map showing all of the lines. That’s the station we want.

Cayla: Don’t we need to get transfers?

Donny: We don’t need transfers to take connecting trains. Let’s see, we want the express, not the local train . . .

Cayla: Are you sure we shouldn’t just ask somebody, like a station agent?

Donny: Good luck finding one. And plus, I don’t need one. I can figure it out. Follow me. I think that’s the right platform.

Cayla: Are you sure that’s the right train?

Donny: Yes, and if you ask me another question, you can continue this conversation with those tracks!

### 0939 Planning a Wedding

Seamus: What’s that?

Cathy: It’s a planning book for our wedding.

Seamus: We aren’t getting married for a year and a half.

Cathy: I know, but there are so many things to plan. We have to book the hall far in advance, you know, and once we set the date, we have to send out save-the-date notifications to our friends and family.

Seamus: I thought that the point of putting off the wedding until we finish school is to take the pressure off and allow us time to plan – later.

Cathy: It is, but it’s never too early to start planning for a wedding. I’m meeting with a wedding coordinator next week to get the ball rolling.

Seamus: A wedding coordinator?! We don’t need a wedding coordinator. We can make all of the arrangements ourselves.

Cathy: You have no idea what goes into pulling off a wedding and reception. There are caterers, photographers and videographers, entertainers, ice sculptors, animal trainers (you know, for the swans and the doves), and . . .

Seamus: Are you serious?! You’re not planning a wedding. You’re starting a circus!

### 0940 Ending Excessive Spending

Raphael: Sorry to be a buzzkill, but this gravy train we’ve been on is about to end.

Kelly: What do you mean?

Raphael: There have been a lot of complaints about our department’s spending on extraneous things, and to quell the masses, the department head is making some major changes.

Kelly: Like what?

Raphael: Like no more frivolous and excessive spending on travel and entertainment at conferences.

Kelly: But those are the only things that make this job bearable. Those perks are part and parcel of working for a government agency – at least that’s what I used to think.

Raphael: Well, once the press got wind of some of our spending practices, they started to question our budget allocations. The long and short of it is that those days are about to end.

Kelly: And I was planning to take you and few other employees to St. Lucia for a retreat in the spring.

Raphael: I think you’d better change those plans, at least the venue. You’d have better luck getting it approved if you picked Cleveland!

### 0941 Types of Shopping Areas

Sarah: Come on! We only have two more hours before the stores close, and I want to make it to the outlet stores.

Aidan: I thought that when you asked if I wanted to spend the day together, you meant we’d go somewhere for lunch, go to a movie, or just hang out.

Sarah: Isn’t this much more fun? Shopping centers are like Disneyland!

Aidan: This wasn’t exactly what I had in mind.

Sara: Just look. You have two shopping malls, retail stores, outlet stores, department stores, and specialty stores. What more could you want?

Aidan: That’s great for you, but what am I supposed to do?

Sarah: You can come with me, watch me try on clothes, and help me decide what to buy. Come on, I want to go to those stores in the strip mall over there.

Aidan: Why don’t I just find a place to get a snack and wait for you? I’m just dead weight when it comes to shopping.

Sarah: But I thought you wanted to spend the day together.

Aidan: I did, but I didn’t know I’d have to go to shopping hell to do it.

### 0942 Daily Chores on a Farm

Cesar: Rise and shine! It’s time to get to work.

Karol: What?! It’s four o’clock in the morning. The sun isn’t even up yet.

Cesar: You live on a farm now. We have a lot of chores to do before sunup and we need to start doing them now.

Karol: I’ll milk the cows later. Let me sleep to a decent hour.

Cesar: All right, you can milk the cows a little later, but we have to feed and water the animals now. We also have to clean out the stalls and groom the animals before we start repairs on the fences.

Karol: Why can’t we do those things when the sun is up and we can see what we’re doing?

Cesar: Because we’ll need daylight hours to tend to the crops. We’re done with planting, but we’ll need to do the watering and weeding. Just be glad that the harvest is three months away.

Karol: I don’t think I’m cut out to be a farmhand.

Cesar: You should have thought of that before agreeing to spend the summer at your uncle’s farm. Now move!

Karol: But I thought I’d spend the days learning how to ride horses.

Cesar: City girls!

### 0943 Making a Will

Last week, I got a wake-up call. One of my oldest friends from high school died suddenly in an accident, leaving no will. With no estate planning at all, his assets went into probate and his dependents were left in limbo.

My friend was a young man, the same age as me. At our age, who thinks about estate planning? Well, he should have, and I’m starting right now to put my affairs in order.

I’ve already decided who will be my beneficiaries and how much of an inheritance each family member will get. One big decision I’m still thinking about is who should be my executor. I want to make sure my bequests are carried out and my assets are properly disposed of, so this person has to be trustworthy.

After I make those decisions, I’ll write a holographic will. It’s the simplest way of drawing up a will and adding codicils without an attorney, and since I’m still of sound mind, there shouldn’t be any problems. I’ll ask my neighbors to be witnesses.

Before I start drawing up my will, though, I still have one other important decision to make. Who should get custody of my eight cats?

### 0944 Working as an Intern

Jonas: How’s your new job?

Crystal: It’s not a job exactly. It’s an internship.

Jonas: Oh, so you’re working as somebody’s lackey and getting paid a pittance.

Crystal: No, not exactly. I’m doing a lot of scut work and I’m not getting paid a lot, but I’m getting very valuable on-the-job experience.

Jonas: Sure you are. You’re learning how to fetch coffee and run errands. Yippee! You don’t have to tell me any more. I know all about it. It’s slave labor.

Crystal: No, it’s not! I’m shadowing one of the managers part of the day and I sit in on important meetings all the time. My mentor shows me how things are done in the business world and gives me great career advice.

Jonas: Well, then you’re lucky. Most interns who work for our company learn diddly-squat and spend their time doing menial work. Some of them are even unpaid. What a racket!

Crystal: In that case, I’m glad I don’t work for your company!

### 0945 Using Electronics While Traveling

Justin: Are you nearly packed?

Marsha: Almost. Let’s see, I have wall chargers for my cell phone and other devices, extra memory cards for my camera, and noise-canceling headphones for the airplane.

Justin: Oh, yeah, I forgot to pack my headphones. I’d better dig them out right now.

Marsha: I’ve also packed portable batteries for our devices in case we run out of power en route. I’ve also brought a power strip to use in our hotel room.

Justin: Why?

Marsha: Hotel rooms never have enough outlets.

Justin: That’s true. I hadn’t thought of that. Maybe I should bring one, too. Between the two of us, we have a lot of gadgets to plug in.

Marsha: And I’m bringing some cables in case we want to hook up our devices to the TV.

Justin: Don’t you think that’s overkill?

Marsha: Not at all. How else will we entertain ourselves for an entire week?

### 0946 Designing a Building

Kathy: Seeing these blueprints really brings this project to life. I can now envision what this building will look like when it’s built.

Brett: I’m really glad. As the architect on this project, it’s my job to turn your ideas into design.

Kathy: You did a great job.

Brett: I had the help of the surveyors and a civil engineer, so I can’t take all of the credit.

Kathy: We’re ready now to solicit bids from general contractors, don’t you think?

Brett: These plans will give any contractor the specifications they need to give a detailed and accurate bid. There’ll be no problems with permits, I don’t think, because a similar structure was on this building site about 10 years ago before it was torn down.

Kathy: I’m hoping not to run into any stumbling blocks, but you never know with a building project. I’ll know we’ve cleared the hurdles when I can bring in the interior designers!

### 0947 Seeing a Circus Performance

Paula: Ta-da! We’re here. This is your big surprise.

Roman: We’re going to the circus?

Paula: You got it in one! It’s going to be great. There’ll be clowns and acrobats, trapeze artists and lion tamers.

Roman: I haven’t been to the circus since I was a kid.

Paula: That’s the point. I thought this would be a nostalgic experience for both of us, and let us feel like kids again.

Roman: I’m not sure . . .

Paula: Come on! We’ll miss the first act. I think there’ll be jugglers, magicians, and tightrope walkers, too.

Roman: Great.

Paula: Listen! I can hear the ringmaster from here. Let’s go!

Roman: When you said that you had a surprise for me that would make me feel young again, this wasn’t exactly what I envisioned.

Paula: I know. It’s even better, right?

Roman: If you say so.

### 0948 Listening to Motivational Speakers

Jamal: I really dread these annual management meetings. We usually have to sit through the most boring motivational speakers giving us pep talks.

Cindy: I think you’ll be surprised by the person they’ve hired to kick off our meeting. She’s supposed to be a guru on crisis management.

Jamal: Oh no, not another one.

Cindy: This one has a lot of real-world experience. She was a fighter pilot who has apparently survived some very difficult missions.

Jamal: What does a fighter pilot know about business? I can’t believe our company is shelling out thousands of dollars on speaking fees for someone like her to tell us how to do our jobs better.

Cindy: I think that the idea is to understand how other organizations and professions handle crises, which may shed some light on how we can do things better.

Jamal: Well, I don’t have high hopes.

Cindy: Don’t you think she can teach us anything?

Jamal: Sure, in fact our speaker has inspired me to try to get on the lecture circuit myself.

Cindy: What would you speak about?

Jamal: Avoiding corporate waste!

### 0949 Dealing With a Contagious Disease

Isabelle: You can’t walk through that door with all of your clothes on!

Linus: What?! I’ve just come off of a 12-hour flight. I’m tired and I want to get into my own house and into my own bed.

Isabelle: I know, but you’ve just returned from McQuillanland, and I’ve just read that anyone who has been there may be a carrier of a communicable disease called Niebola. It can be transmitted through casual contact, so even if you don’t have it, you could spread it.

Linus: So what am I supposed to do? Stand out here for the rest of my life?

Isabelle: Of course not. Take off your clothes.

Linus: You want me to take off my clothes in front of the house? Are you crazy?!

Isabelle: No, the best way to prevent the spread of this infectious disease is to burn clothing that has been in contact with it, and to bathe you thoroughly.

Linus: I’m not stripping down to my underwear out here.

Isabelle: But aren’t you worried about transmitting Niebola to me and everyone you know? No one is immune. You could start an epidemic!

Linus: All right, but I’m going around to the back door where no one can see me, okay?

Isabelle: Great! I’ll get your bath ready. I just have to heat the mayonnaise.

Linus: What?! You want me to take a bath in mayonnaise?

Isabelle: That’s the only way to kill Niebola.

### 0950 Visiting a Construction Site

Bill: Ma’am! Ma’am!

Estelle: Yes?

Bill: Ma’am, you’re not supposed to be here. This is a construction site and you’re not allowed. Please don’t step on that scaffolding. It’s dangerous.

Estelle: Oh, I just wanted a quick look to see how the building is coming along. Look at all this lumber and brick. The foundation is already done and the beams and rafters are going up. This is so exciting!

Bill: Ma’am, this is a dangerous area, especially for someone not wearing a hard hat.

Estelle: I won’t stay very long. I just wanted to see the progress.

Bill: Watch out!

Estelle: Oh, I almost tripped over these pickaxes and shovels and landed in the wheelbarrow. Thank you for saving me.

Bill: You’re welcome. Now let me escort you off the site.

Estelle: But I wanted to see that bulldozer and crane over there.

Bill: You can see them just fine from the street. And from the street you won’t be my responsibility!

### 0951 Parts of a Hospital

Jordan: Excuse me, my girlfriend was brought into the hospital about two hours ago, but I can’t find her.

Admissions Clerk: Why was she brought into the hospital?

Jordan: I’m not sure. I got a call from her coworker, but she didn’t give me any details.

Admissions Clerk: If it weren’t an accident, then she wouldn’t be in the emergency room or the trauma unit.

Jordan: It may have been her heart. She has a heart condition.

Admissions Clerk: Then she might be in the cardiology department. If she is in severe condition, she’ll be in the ICU.

Jordan: It may also be the baby. She’s pregnant.

Admissions Clerk: Then she might be in the obstetrics and gynecology department. And if the baby has been born, it would be in the neonatal unit.

Jordan: I’m just not sure where to go. Maybe I’ll start in the cardiology department.

Admissions Clerk: That’s fine. Go past the neurology and oncology departments and it’s on your right. If you see the burn unit, then you’ve gone too far.

Jordan: You can’t look her up for me to see if she’s been admitted?

Admissions Clerk: I’m sorry, but our computer systems are down right now. If you wait until they’re up again, I can try to find her for you.

Jordan: And go out of my mind worrying? No thanks. I’m going to find her, even if I have to look behind every bedpan!

### 0952 Dealing With Rising Production Costs

Giovanni: There are no two ways about it. We have to raise prices.

Melanie: We can’t. We already raised prices earlier this year. Doing it again risks alienating our customers.

Giovanni: What else can we do? Our production costs have risen nearly 15 percent. We’ve tried absorbing them and offsetting them, but nothing has worked. Our profit margin continues to shrink and we don’t have any other choice.

Melanie: What about lowering the quality of our raw materials? We could use a cheaper supplier.

Giovanni: That’s a sure way to lose customers. If we start cutting corners on quality, our customers will leave in droves.

Melanie: What if we discontinue manufacturing some of the less popular items? That should save us some money.

Giovanni: Not enough. We either raise prices or stop production altogether.

Melanie: There is one other option.

Giovanni: What?

Melanie: We could reduce our workforce.

Giovanni: You mean fire people? That’s off the table!

### 0953 Living With Insects and Spiders

Judith: Ahh! Get it off me!

Murad: It’s just a tiny spider. Don’t freak out.

Judith: I hate spiders. What is this place you’ve brought me to?

Murad: It’s one of the most beautiful spots in the world, and we’ll be staying here tonight.

Judith: You mean we’ll be roughing it in this cabin? Is that a cockroach that just ran across the floor?

Murad: Maybe. In this place, you’ll see some of the most amazing things. It’s the next best thing to sleeping in the open.

Judith: Great. Can you close that window? There are flies and moths everywhere, and I think those were bees and wasps just outside the door.

Murad: They won’t bother you if you don’t bother them. Listen to that! We can fall asleep to the sound of crickets.

Judith: Ouch! I think I’ve just been bitten by a giant mosquito.

Murad: You’re imagining things. Look at those butterflies just outside the window. Don’t you think they’re beautiful?

Judith: Do you know what would look beautiful to me right now? A really big mosquito net!

### 0954 Participating in Winter Sports

Hanna: It’s finally snowing outside! Soon we’ll be able to get out the sled.

Ahmed: Sledding is for kids. I’m going downhill skiing as soon as there’s enough powder. I can’t wait to feel the wind in my hair as I careen down the side of a mountain.

Hanna: You’re more likely to be on the bunny slopes! You’ve only been on a snowmobile once and gone cross-country skiing a few times. What makes you think you’ll be able to ski the slopes like an expert?

Ahmed: I can ice skate better than you can, so no matter what, I know I’ll be better at it than you’ll be. When I get the hang of skiing, I’ll probably try snowboarding.

Hanna: Now I know you’re blowing smoke. You don’t have the nerve.

Ahmed: Oh, yeah? I challenge you a game of one-on-one ice hockey.

Hanna: You’re twice my size! Make it a snowball fight.

Ahmed: You’re on!

### 0955 Dating a Possessive Person

Eliana: You’re here! I didn’t think you’d be able to come.

Matt: Why? I like seeing a movie with my friends as much as the next guy.

Eliana: Yeah, but it’s been weeks since we’ve seen you, ever since you started dating Helen.

Matt: She doesn’t own me. She’s a little possessive, but I put my foot down when she gets too clingy.

Eliana: Doesn’t she get jealous if you so much as look at another woman?

Matt: She’s the jealous type, that’s true, but I reassure her all the time that she’s the only one I want. It’s true that she’s critical of other women, too, but what woman isn’t? She’s fine if she knows where I am and whom I’m with.

Eliana: You mean you have to report in to her on your whereabouts?

Matt: She likes to know what I’m doing. She’s just concerned about me, that’s all.

Eliana: She seems really controlling.

Matt: What did you say?

Eliana: Nothing. I see Xavier and Sophie over there. Ready to get our tickets?

Matt: Hold on one second. I just need to text Helen an update. If she doesn’t hear from me every half hour, she worries. Isn’t that sweet?

### 0956 Running a Family-Owned Business

When I took over the family business three years ago, I didn’t know what I was letting myself in for. My uncle, who ran the business before me, established a clear chain of command, which I thought would eliminate infighting and bickering. I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Despite clear lines of authority, family members tend to take sides and play the blame game whenever anything goes wrong. In the end, they always look to me to resolve conflict, and I have no choice but to enter the fray.

Another big problem is the hangers-on. Those are the family members who aren’t suited for this line of work, but who need jobs. What do I DO with them?

What do you do when everything falls on your shoulders? Well, I’ve developed a thick skin, and when someone inevitably reminds me that blood is thicker than water, I remind them that business is business.

### 0957 Doping in Sports

Mia: This is ridiculous! They’re going to suspend Eric Rodrigo for doping.

Alex: From what I’ve read, he failed his random drug test and they found performance-enhancing drugs in his system.

Mia: But he’s one of the best players on the team. Without him, we won’t have a chance to get to the playoffs.

Alex: He should have thought of that before he decided to cheat. I’m surprised they’re only suspending him for a few games. Last year, a player on another team was banned for life from the sport and stripped of his championship titles.

Mia: In my opinion, they completely overreacted and one of the best players in the game is off the field forever.

Alex: You don’t think that people who use steroids and other banned substances should be punished?

Mia: Not when the fans are the ones who really pay the price.

Alex: So you’re in favor of allowing performance-enhancing drugs in sports?

Mia: Sure, why not? If everybody is doping, it levels the playing field.

Alex: I am really glad you’re not the commissioner!

### 0958 Selecting a Neighborhood to Live In

Leona: I want to live close to downtown. We can get everywhere on foot and walk to most amenities.

Jeremy: Downtown is always bustling and noisy, and the crime rate is really high. I’d rather have proximity to parks and open spaces.

Leona: If we lived downtown, we wouldn’t have to worry about commute time and traffic. I could walk to work and you could take public transportation.

Jeremy: That’s true, but there aren’t any good schools near downtown.

Leona: Hello, we don’t have any kids.

Jeremy: Not yet. I want to settle down somewhere for a while, not move every couple of years.

Leona: Is that why you want to live in the suburbs? The suburbs have no character. Everything is cookie-cutter.

Jeremy: That’s not true.

Leona: Downtown has character and it’s close to nightlife.

Jeremy: That’s less important to me than a place in a quiet neighborhood. Imagine lounging in the backyard or taking a walk in the park. We can raise our kids in a close-knit community.

Leona: I think you’re planning for a family that we don’t have.

Jeremy: Yet!

### 0959 A Territorial Dispute

Roberta: So this is McQuillanland!

Eli: Well, that depends on whom you ask. This area has been under territorial dispute since 1963.

Roberta: Who else claims it?

Eli: Its neighbor, Tseland. Tseland annexed it after the brief war in 1963, but McQuillanland refuses to recognize the change in boundaries.

Roberta: I didn’t know that.

Eli: McQuillanland contends that the demarcation for the border is this river, but Tseland says that it rules over this entire valley. Since most of the people who live here consider themselves McQuillanlanders, they say possession is nine-tenths of the law.

Roberta: Wasn’t there a treaty at the end of the conflict?

Eli: There was, but the wording was vague and the dispute has continued to this day.

Roberta: So if we committed a crime right here, right now, which country would have jurisdiction?

Eli: Let’s not find out.

### 0960 Giving Someone Your Recommendation

Jimmy: My cousin Sal said that he put in an application for a job here.

Suzanne: Yeah, that’s right.

Jimmy: Well?

Suzanne: Well, what?

Jimmy: Are you going to hire him?

Suzanne: I’m not sure. He doesn’t have any experience and he didn’t provide any references.

Jimmy: I can vouch for him. Sal is solid. He’s a really nice guy.

Suzanne: I appreciate you putting in a good word for him, but I need more assurance than that he’s a nice guy. He needs to have the temperament, work ethic, and skills for this job.

Jimmy: What he doesn’t know he’ll learn on the job. He’s a quick study.

Suzanne: How can I justify hiring someone with no experience, while passing up applicants who are better qualified?

Jimmy: He has my ringing endorsement. What else do you need? He’ll work as hard as I do.

Suzanne: That’s exactly what I’m afraid of.

### 0961 Learning to Dance

Arthur: You know that you’ve taken on an impossible task, right?

Martha: Teaching you to dance? I’m sure you’re selling yourself short.

Arthur: No, really, I have two left feet. I’m completely uncoordinated and have no sense of rhythm. I’m just not cut out for dancing.

Martha: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll just start by loosening up and swaying to the music. You don’t even need to swing your hips yet.

Arthur: That’s good, because I don’t think I can learn even the simplest dance steps.

Martha: Not only will I teach you some useful dance steps, we’ll put together a dance routine down the line.

Arthur: That seems like a pipe dream to me.

Martha: Nonsense. Before long, dancing to you will be as effortless as breathing.

Arthur: But until then, I’ll look and feel like a dancing hippo!

### 0962 Recovering After a Setback

Carl: Come on, let’s go. I have $500 burning a hole in my pocket.

Shelly: Where are we going?

Carl: We’re going to the track. I have a tip on a sure thing for one of this afternoon’s races. This is exactly what I need after last week’s setback.

Shelly: You mean after losing all of your money last week.

Carl: Right, but all I need to do is to get that monkey off my back and then I’ll have a reversal of fortune. Winning big this afternoon will be the start of a new winning streak.

Shelly: Maybe what happened last week is really a sign of things to come. Maybe it was the start of a losing streak.

Carl: Don’t jinx me with that kind of negativity. I’ve always believed that when you meet with a setback, come back with all you’ve got.

Shelly: Does that mean what I think it means?

Carl: Yes, that’s right. I’m plunking down all $500 on that race. I can’t lose.

Shelly: But what if –

Carl: Don’t say another word. When I win and get back in my stride, you can say, “Congratulations!”

### 0963 Admiring a Baby

Maya: Isn’t this baby precious? She is just darling. Coo chi coo.

Jean-Paul: Why do women fawn over babies? One baby looks pretty much like any other.

Maya: You wouldn’t say that if you’d ever spent time with babies. Come over here and look at this one. She’s a doll and her face is so expressive. Aren’t you a little doll? Aren’t you?

Jean-Paul: I’m not wasting my time looking at a little brat. Let’s go.

Maya: Wait, she’s smiling. Come look!

Jean-Paul: She has gas and needs to be burped. I don’t even need to look at her to know that.

Maya: You wouldn’t say that if you looked at her face. She has the most angelic expression on her face and the sweetest temperament.

Jean-Paul: Whatever.

Maya: Just come over here and look at her.

Jean-Paul: You’re not going to let me leave without looking at her, are you?

Maya: I think you’ll find her just as lovable and adorable as I do.

Jean-Paul: All right, let’s take a look at this precious darling of an angel with an expressive face.

Maya: See what I mean?

Jean-Paul: She is, well, kind of cute and cuddly.

Maya: When you see her don’t you just want to . . .

Jean-Paul: Coo chi coo. Coo chi coo.

### 0964 Using Infographics

Mario: That’s a lot of text in your proposal. Are you sure people are going to take the time to read all of that?

Cleo: It’s a complex proposal with a lot of moving parts. I can’t simplify it without leaving out essentials.

Mario: What you need are infographics. You can encapsulate and communicate a lot of information by using visuals.

Cleo: This is a serious business proposal. I want people to take it seriously, and I don’t want them to get distracted by a lot of color pictures.

Mario: That’s precisely why you have to use infographics. Look at these reports and proposals I’ve received in the past year. Everybody is communicating complex sets of information and statistics in maps and graphics. You can even show hierarchies and networks easily using infographics.

Cleo: I didn’t know it could be done in such a professional way, but I don’t know the first thing about creating infographics.

Mario: Lucky for you, I know an expert.

Cleo: Who?

Mario: Someone who is enormously talented, but underappreciated.

Cleo: I don’t think I know anyone like that.

Mario: Hmph!

### 0965 Meeting Your Boyfriend’s/Girlfriend’s Parents

Ronny: Ready?

Judy: Ready as I’ll ever be.

Ronny: Try to work up a little enthusiasm about meeting my parents.

Judy: It’s not them I’m worried about. It’s me. What if I don’t pass muster?

Ronny: My parents are going to love you. They’re open-minded and nonjudgmental people. They won’t care about anything except that I like you and you make me happy.

Judy: Me and parents are like oil and water. I’ve never been good at making a good first impression.

Ronny: Then you’ll gradually win them over. Meeting my parents will be a cakewalk. They’re nice people. It’s not like you’ll be running the gauntlet meeting my nine brothers.

Judy: You didn’t tell them I’d be meeting your parents tonight, did you?

Ronny: I may have mentioned it to Mark. Why?

Judy: What if they decide to show up and ambush me?

Ronny: They won’t.

Judy: If you found out that one of your brothers were bringing a girlfriend home to meet your parents, wouldn’t you want to be there?

Ronny: You have a point there, but it’s too late to back out now. Put on your game face and let’s go, or we’ll be late.

Judy: Okay, but just don’t be surprised if I make a break for it.

### 0966 Converting to Another Religion

Debbie: Okay, I’m off. I’ll be back around eight o’clock.

Marcelo: Hey, where are you going in such a hurry?

Debbie: I’m going to my religious education class.

Marcelo: Religious education class? What’s that about?

Debbie: Well, I’ve decided to convert to McQuillanism.

Marcelo: I’m not familiar with that denomination. It is Christian, isn’t it?

Debbie: No, it isn’t, but there are some similarities in the spiritual teachings between McQuillanism and Christianity, but we have different ways of worshiping – different prayers, hymns, and rituals.

Marcelo: It doesn’t sound legit. Are you sure McQuillanism isn’t really a cult?

Debbie: Of course not. My spiritual leader has been tutoring me on the tenets of the faith so I understand it, but I can see why you’d question it, since you don’t know anything about it.

Marcelo: Well, as long as you’re satisfied.

Debbie: I am and I can’t wait to become a full-fledged McQuillanite. McQuillanism is a little unconventional, but we take our faith very seriously.

Marcelo: Have it your way. What’s that you’re carrying?

Debbie: It’s a cat costume. As I said, we do things a little differently.

Marcelo: I’m sorry I asked.

### 0967 Feeling Embarrassed

Lois: Please don’t embarrass me at the party tonight.

Roger: Me, embarrass you? I’d never do that.

Lois: You have, though, more than once.

Roger: Name one.

Lois: At the Johnsons’ party, you danced on the table while singing “I Am Woman”!

Roger: I was being the life of the party. Everybody thought it was funny.

Lois: It was humiliating! Didn’t you notice more than one person cringing and the awkward silence in the room when your song ended?

Roger: No, I didn’t, but I did notice Malik laughing his head off and the Johnsons smiling.

Lois: That’s because Malik has your sense of humor and the Johnsons were humoring you. They were trying to put a good face on your impromptu performance.

Roger: I’m not going to be a wallflower just because you can’t take a joke. My exuberant personality is what gets us invited to so many parties.

Lois: Yeah, right. Can I at least get you to promise not to sing?

Roger: And disappoint my audience? Not a chance!

### 0968 Recording an Outgoing Voice Mail Message

I hate the sound of my own voice. I always have. When I’m speaking to an audience, I always sound forced and unnatural. So when we had to set up our new voice mail system’s outgoing message, it took me a few tries to get it right.

“Hello, you’ve reached Martin Navra at McQ Corp. I’m not available to take your call right now. Please leave a message and I’ll call you back as soon as I can. Thank you for calling.”

No, that wasn’t quite right. I gave it another shot.

“Hello, you’ve reached the voice mail for Martin Navra at McQ Corp. I’m in a meeting or away from my desk. Please leave a message and I’ll call you back as soon as I can. If your call is urgent, please contact Julia Mann at 555-434-3232. Thank you.”

That seemed okay, but since I was leaving on vacation next week, I needed to record a temporary outgoing message as well. This is what I came up with:

“Hello, you’ve reached the voice mail of Martin Navra at McQ Corp. I will be on vacation from March 3rd through March 10th. If you need to reach someone immediately, please call Julia Mann at 555-434-3232, or dial “0” to reach reception. Otherwise, please leave a message and I’ll return your call when I return. Thank you.”

I was finally done. The good thing is, whenever I call to retrieve my voice mail messages, I can bypass my outgoing message. With any luck, I’ll never have to hear my own voice again – ever!

### 0969 Using Electronics on Airplanes

Flight attendant: I’m sorry, sir, but all passengers need to turn off their portable electronic devices for takeoff, so you’ll need to turn off your laptop.

Alec: I just need to finish one last email.

Flight attendant: Sir, we can’t take off until you turn that computer off.

Alec: Fine. It’s off. Why all the fuss, anyway?

Flight attendant: It’s regulations. Signals emitted by electronics may interfere with the plane’s communication systems or navigation.

Alec: All right.

Flight attendant: Sir, you’ll also need to turn off your tablet computer and your cell phone. Those are also considered portable electronic devices.

Alec: You’ve got to be kidding me. You mean I have to sit here twiddling my thumbs while I wait for the plane to take off? I thought the FAA eased up on those regulations.

Flight attendant: I’m afraid not, sir. Please power down all of your devices so we can proceed with takeoff.

Alec: Okay, fine. What am I suppose to do until we get the all clear to use our electronics again?

Flight attendant: Perhaps you could read a magazine.

Alec: That’s what I was doing on my tablet before you made me turn it off.

Flight attendant: Perhaps you could take a flying leap out the window.

Alec: What did you say?

Flight attendant: I said, “Look at that luggage heap out the window.”

### 0970 Having a Backup Plan

Jerome: This is a very dangerous undertaking. Do you have a backup plan if anything goes wrong?

Sandy: It’ll work. I’ve come up with contingencies for every possible setback.

Jerome: It’s just that I’d like to know we have some recourse if anything goes wrong.

Sandy: My plan is foolproof. Failure is not an option.

Jerome: But don’t you think we should consider some alternatives? If, God forbid, anything goes wrong, it would be good to have an escape hatch, don’t you think?

Sandy: That won’t be necessary. If anything goes wrong, it’s every man for himself.

Jerome: What?! I thought we were in this together? What happened to, “Stick with me and you can’t go wrong”?

Sandy: That was before I realized what a liability you are.

Jerome: A liability?!

Sandy: In a dangerous plan like this, there are bound to be some casualties – a sacrificial lamb or two.

Jerome: Yes, but I didn’t know you’d double-cross me before we even got started!

### 0971 Getting in to See a Busy Doctor

Monique: Ugh!

Jurgen: What’s the matter?

Monique: My GP referred me to a specialist for my back problems, but she doesn’t have any openings for eight weeks! I’m waitlisted in case there’s a cancellation, but if there isn’t one, I’ll have to endure this pain for at least another eight weeks.

Jurgen: Can’t you just go see another specialist?

Monique: I could, but my GP says that she’s the best in the business. In the meantime, I’ll try to see a physical therapist about my neck. It’s flaring up again.

Jurgen: At least you’ll get some relief.

Monique: Maybe. I have to call back tomorrow morning to see if she can fit me in. She’s really booked up, too. While I’m waiting, I guess I could try to see the podiatrist about my feet.

Jurgen: You’re having feet problems, too?

Monique: Yeah, my whole body is falling apart. I think I’m nearly past my expiration date!

### 0972 Paying an Employee Under the Table

Martin: I’m confused. I’ve been going over the books and I don’t see several members of the staff listed and accounted for.

Jina: Oh, I have a special arrangement with a few of them. I pay them under the table.

Martin: Are you sure that’s wise? You could get busted for tax evasion.

Jina: No one will be the wiser if I pay a few people off the books. All of the people I hire want a job, and a few of them I pay under the minimum wage. Since they don’t have to report their income, they come out ahead in the end. So what’s the problem?

Martin: I just want to make sure you’re aware of the ramifications. If the government finds out about it, you could be up the creek.

Jina: I’m not worried. Everybody does it.

Martin: If you say so. I’m willing to turn a blind eye, but you’re on your own if you get audited!

### 0973 Attracting Someone’s Interest

Angie: Ooh, it looks like Joanna has her sights set on you. Look at how she’s giving you the eye.

Kenji: Is she? I hadn’t noticed.

Angie: Watch out, she usually gets what she wants and she doesn’t take no for an answer.

Kenji: I’m not interested in Joanna at all. She’s not my type.

Angie: Then you’re the only one. Every guy I know thinks she’s hot. She has a bunch of them at her beck and call.

Kenji: Then she won’t care if I don’t take an interest in her. I don’t like women who behave as though they’re God’s gift to men.

Angie: Don’t look now, but she’s making a beeline for you.

Kenji: Then that’s my cue to beat a speedy exit.

Angie: Are you sure you want to give her the brush off?

Kenji: I’m sure. That’s one woman I don’t want to tangle with.

### 0974 Talking About Old Crimes

Paul: What are you watching?

Della: I’m watching a really good show about cold cases. They take unsolved crimes from decades ago and reconstruct them, trying to solve them once and for all.

Paul: But after all this time, isn’t the trail cold? How do they solve the crimes with no new leads?

Della: They go over the witness testimony and use scientific methods that didn’t exist many years ago.

Paul: Isn’t there a statute of limitations for most crimes?

Della: Yes, but not for murder.

Paul: I really doubt a TV show can solve crimes that the police couldn’t crack. Are any crimes really ever solved on the show?

Della: Yes, of course.

Paul: How? Through crack investigative methods or a keen eye for detail?

Della: Deathbed confessions.

Paul: Ah.

### 0975 Making Food from Scratch

Ann: I’m so excited to have the entire family coming for a visit. For our first family dinner next Friday, I’m making everything from scratch. I’m pulling out all the stops.

Walt: But have you ever made anything from scratch?

Ann: Sure I have, plenty of times.

Walt: If you say so, but our pantry is full of canned foods and jars, and nearly everything we’ve cooked in the past year has been premixed. Are you sure you’re up to cooking a dinner for 12 from scratch?

Ann: How hard could it be? I just need to make sure that the ingredients I buy are fresh, follow the recipes closely, add plenty of fresh herbs and spices, and multitask.

Walt: You mean do a juggling act. It’ll take a lot of work and organization to pull this off.

Ann: I’m up to the challenge. And I have a backup plan.

Walt: And that is?

Ann: Have you ever heard of the raw food movement?

### 0976 Showing Immaturity

Romero: Are you going to tell Amber that she can’t have Saturday off of work or should I?

Alice: You’d better tell her. I don’t think she’s going to take it well.

Romero: I’ll do it, but I’m not looking forward to it. She can be really immature when she doesn’t get what she wants.

Alice: Yeah, that’s why I don’t like working with her. If things don’t go her way, she pouts and whines. I don’t know why they don’t fire her.

Romero: I think she’s just a little inexperienced. This is her first job, after all. Some of her behavior is pretty childish, but when she’s not kicking up a fuss or moaning about something, she does good work.

Alice: That’s like saying somebody is a good worker when they’re not napping!

Romero: She’s not that bad, but we do have to look past some juvenile antics when our employees are so young.

Alice: Yeah, too bad we can’t have seniors selling to teenagers.

Romero: I think that would open a whole different can of worms!

### 0977 Parts of the Body

Sonia: What in the world is that?!

Nadir: It’s a life-size figure of George Washington. It’s for Leon’s school project.

Sonia: Then why are you making it?

Nadir: I’m not. I’m just helping him.

Sonia: Uh-huh. Why does George Washington have really big hands and flat palms?

Nadir: He cut down the family’s cherry tree. Remember? He probably needed big hands to do that.

Sonia: And why does he have little tiny feet with six toes on each foot and no ankles?

Nadir: I made a little mistake with those, but they’ll be covered up with shoes, so no one will see them.

Sonia: And why is George’s head shaped like an egg? His ears are lopsided and his earlobes are disproportionate to his other facial features.

Nadir: That’s why I made the forehead and chin bigger, so no one will notice those ears. We’ll probably put a hat on him anyway.

Sonia: But his legs look really thin on top and thick on the bottom, with kneecaps that stick out.

Nadir: I’ll put pants on him, so no one will see those either.

Sonia: So it won’t matter if he’s not anatomically correct, right?

Nadir: Right.

Sonia: Good thing this isn’t for science class!

### 0978 Getting Access to Restricted Areas

Security officer: Excuse me, sir, but this is a restricted area. Only authorized personnel are permitted.

Carl: I just want to take a quick look. Is this really where the president will be speaking?

Security officer: I can neither confirm nor deny that, sir. Please step aside.

Carl: What if I have press credentials? Could I get in then?

Security officer: Only if you’ve been screened by security. Really, sir, I must ask you to leave this area. It’s off-limits to you.

Carl: Couldn’t I just hang around and watch while people arrive? I won’t say a word.

Security officer: No, and if you persist, I’ll have to have you shown out.

Carl: I’m not causing any trouble. I’m an American citizen and this is a free country! I can stand wherever I want to.

Security officer: Not on private property. Jim, could you please escort this gentleman off the premises?

Carl: Hey, this is a travesty! I’m going to file a formal protest!

Security officer: You do that. Just do it off the premises.

### 0979 Types of Humor

Kyle: Are you watching that sitcom again? It’s so stupid. There’s nothing witty or original about the humor.

Paulina: I don’t need highbrow jokes. I enjoy all kinds of comedy.

Kyle: You mean you like screwball and slapstick humor.

Paulina: Yes, so?

Kyle: So? It’s so juvenile.

Paulina: I know that it’s hard for people like you who like satire to appreciate the more wacky kinds of humor, but you might try getting off your high horse once in a while.

Kyle: I’m not snooty. I’m just discriminating. I like comedians with a dry sense of humor like that self-deprecating guy on that show I watch.

Paulina: That show is a snoozefest. That guy bores me to death.

Kyle: And this show does it for you?

Paulina: You bet.

Kyle: There’s no accounting for taste!

### 0980 Retiring Abroad

Wanda: I just heard the news. You’re moving to McQuillanland?

George: I am. I’ve decided to retire abroad.

Wanda: Why?

George: It makes a lot of sense for people with a fixed income. Social Security will only go so far here, but the cost of living is much lower in other countries, including McQuillanland. I can live it up at a fraction of the cost of living modestly here.

Wanda: But you’re moving away from all of your friends and family.

George: I can stay in touch remotely, and there is an American expat community there so I can make new friends. I am a little worried about learning the language and adjusting to life abroad, but I’ll be living a simpler life there and there’ll be less stress.

Wanda: But sometimes things aren’t so reliable when you live abroad.

George: Like what?

Wanda: I’ve heard that the Internet services can be unreliable and power outages are common in McQuillanland. Are you sure you want to put down stakes in a foreign country?

George: What do I have to lose? I already have my residency visa and a condo on the beach waiting for me. The real question is: when are you going to take the plunge?

### 0981 Diplomatic and Economic Sanctions

Andy: Well, it’s happened.

Marjorie: What’s happened?

Andy: The U.S. has placed diplomatic and economic sanctions on McQuillanland. It’s about time! The McQuillanland government has violated international law for the last time!

Marjorie: That’s great, but what does it really mean?

Andy: Well, it means that all high-level talks between the U.S. and McQuillanland have been called off, and the U.S. embassy is closing.

Marjorie: That sounds serious.

Andy: You bet it is, and that’s just the beginning. With economic sanctions, there’ll be serious consequences for business and trade. There’ll be an embargo on U.S. companies doing business there, and there’ll be a naval blockade to enforce it.

Marjorie: Wow, the McQuillanlanders have really done it this time.

Andy: They have. What made them think they could thumb their noses at us and get away with it?

Marjorie: I have no idea, but they’re about to find out what the repercussions are when they flout international law!

### 0982 Home Shopping

Victor: Turn off the TV and put down that phone. I know what you’re about to do.

Julia: I wasn’t going to do anything.

Victor: You’re watching the home shopping channel and you have the phone in your hand, which means you’re about to call them and order something. Admit it.

Julia: I just wanted to ask some questions about this amazing item that’s on-screen right now. It’s 30 percent off if I call within the next eight minutes. Look how nice it looks on the model. It’s a limited edition necklace. If I don’t call soon, they’ll be sold out!

Victor: That’s why I have to keep you from calling. You don’t need another piece of second-rate jewelry from the home shopping channel.

Julia: Oh, look what you’ve done! They’re sold out. But hey, look at that machine they’re demonstrating. It’s amazing what it can do.

Victor: You don’t need another ridiculous gadget that you buy after watching some rigged demonstration. You know that they never work the same way at home as they do on TV.

Julia: Some of them do. Remember that machine I bought for washing nuts? That worked well.

Victor: Yeah, and how much use did we get out of that? We have an entire garage full of steals you just couldn’t resist. That’s why I need to do something drastic.

Julia: What?

Victor: I’m confiscating that remote!

### 0983 Breaking Bad Habits

Counselor: Welcome, everybody. You’ve all joined this support group because you have some bad habits that you’d like to break. Would anyone like to introduce themselves and tell us about their bad habit?

Stu: Uh yeah, I’m Stu and my wife signed me up for this support group because she says I have some really bad habits. One of my worst is my nail biting. You can see that they’re pretty ragged.

Counselor: Thank you, Stu. Is there anyone else . . .?

Stu: Oh yeah, I also smack my gum. That drives my wife crazy, so I try not to do it in her presence.

Counselor: Well, thanks for sharing, Stu. If we could move on to . . .

Stu: I also tend to tap my fingers and crack my joints, which my wife says is really annoying, though her hair twirling is pretty annoying to me.

Counselor: Stu? Let’s let a few other people . . .

Stu: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention what my wife says is my most annoying bad habit.

Counselor: What is that?

Stu: I tend to interrupt people in conversation.

Counselor: Really? I hadn’t noticed.

### 0984 Competing in Business

Yoko: We used to be the only game in town. Now we have three competitors and they are luring away our customers.

Cedric: I know. We need to do something before we go under. What about price matching?

Yoko: Our prices are already competitive. If we want to focus on price, we’ll need to undercut our competitors.

Cedric: Slashing prices would be really hard on our profit margin, but these are desperate times. What do you think of a two-for-one deal? We could offer it for a limited time.

Yoko: We can do that if lowering our prices doesn’t work. I’m thinking we could go in another direction. What do you think about offering freebies or gifts with purchase?

Cedric: I think that’s a good idea. The more frills we include, the better our services look. What kind of frills?

Yoko: I’m not sure, but the more bells and whistles the better.

Cedric: And if all of this doesn’t work?

Yoko: Then we’ll be up the creek without a paddle!

### 0985 School Fundraisers

Valerie: What’s this?

A.J.: It’s a note from Rachel’s school. It’s about the next fundraiser.

Valerie: Oh no, not another one. What is it this time – a raffle, car wash, or spaghetti dinner?

A.J.: It’s none of those things. It’s a combination bake sale and craft sale. Parents are supposed to donate baked goods and handmade items.

Valerie: This is crazy. Every month there’s something else. Last month, it was a candy sale. I had to hit up everybody at work, and that’s on the tail of raffle tickets the month before. It’s like this every year.

A.J.: I know. We already donated a lot of things to the rummage sale last semester and gift certificates for the silent auction two months ago. With two kids in two different schools, I feel like we never get a breather.

Valerie: I know, and there’s more. Brian’s school is asking parents to buy a brick that will be part of a new school building and our names will be engraved on it.

A.J.: You’re kidding, right? One more fundraiser and my name will get engraved, all right – on my tombstone!

### 0986 Buying and Selling Family Heirlooms

Anne: Where are you going with that?

Ivan: I’m taking this clock to an antique dealer. Rather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.

Anne: You can’t sell that! It belonged to our grandfather. It’s a family heirloom.

Ivan: It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a clock that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from one generation to another. I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable. These clocks could be a dime a dozen.

Anne: But it’s valuable to me. It has sentimental value. As a little girl, I remember visiting Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf. If I had inherited it, I know I wouldn’t be looking to sell it to make a quick buck.

Ivan: I’m not looking to make a quick buck, but what if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be able to put the money that it would fetch to good use.

Anne: Well, are you? Are you going to put the proceeds to good use?

Ivan: Sure, of course I am.

Anne: Are you going to tell me what you’re spending it on?

Ivan: Not on your life!

### 0987 Taking Prescription Drugs

Paula: Okay, I’m off to bed.

Marcus: Wait a second. Where are you going with all of those pill bottles?

Paula: My doctor prescribed a couple of medications to help me sleep.

Marcus: Let me see those. You have four different medications here. This is a painkiller, this is a sedative, this is a tranquilizer, and this is a stimulant.

Paula: I don’t take that last one when I go to bed.

Marcus: You mean you take the first three every night?

Paula: Not every night.

Marcus: I can’t believe that your doctor would prescribe all three of these medications just to help you sleep. This seems like overkill.

Paula: I saw more than one doctor. They each gave me a different prescription.

Marcus: How do you know they won’t interact and produce side effects?

Paula: A doctor prescribed each one. I’m sure they’re safe.

Marcus: Yes, but does the left hand know what the right hand is doing? I’m confiscating these until you can talk to a doctor or pharmacist to make sure you won’t overdose by taking all three of these at one time.

Paula: But how will I fall asleep until then?

Marcus: You’re always telling me how boring I am. I’ll just regale you with stories of my youth. Let’s start at the beginning. My earliest memory is . . .

### 0988 Playing Fair in Business

Marcel: Hey, why do you have the file for the Donovan account on your desk? I thought that was Evan’s account.

Amanda: It is, but I’m about to snatch it from him. He won’t know what hit him.

Marcel: You’re stealing his account? If you do that, you’d better watch your back.

Amanda: You’ve got it all wrong. This is payback. Three months ago, when I was on the verge of getting the Moralez account, Evan swooped in and snagged it. He doesn’t play fair, and now neither do I.

Marcel: This sounds like the beginning of a feud.

Amanda: Evan started it. If he wants to play hardball, then what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.

Marcel: You’re not worried that he’ll up the ante and try to do something even more underhanded?

Amanda: Evan doesn’t scare me.

Marcel: This could easily escalate.

Amanda: Like I said, I’m not afraid of Evan. This is business. If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

### 0989 Dealing with a Mass Transit Strike

Marge: Where have you been? You should have been home over two hours ago!

Homer: I’ve been trying to get home. Haven’t you been watching the news? The Transportation Workers Union has voted to strike. There was a mass walkout at 4:30 p.m. today.

Marge: You’re kidding! I didn’t know anything about it. They walked off the job right before the afternoon commute?

Homer: Yeah, I think it was calculated to make the biggest impact so that the powers that be will sit up and take notice.

Marge: You mean the walkout has halted services on all public transportation – all buses, trains, and subways?

Homer: Yes, that’s right. Everything is at a standstill. There are a lot of disgruntled commuters out there.

Marge: When will services be restored?

Homer: I have no idea. I imagine things won’t get back to normal before tomorrow morning’s commute.

Marge: So what are you going to do?

Homer: I might have to stay home from work. I’m stranded with no mass transit services.

Marge: Oh, that’s a shame.

Homer: Isn’t it, though?

### 0990 Being Socially Popular

Rosa: Has the mail come yet?

Grant: We didn’t get any mail today.

Rosa: Damn it!

Grant: What’s the matter?

Rosa: I’m waiting for an invitation from Joanna to her birthday party. I heard that she’s having a big bash, and it’s going to be the party of the season.

Grant: You’re worked up over a party?

Rosa: It’s not just any party. It’s the social event of the year. Anyone who’s anybody will be there. If I don’t get an invitation, it means I’ve been snubbed. I’d never be able to live it down.

Grant: Who is Joanna anyway? She’s just another rich girl, right?

Rosa: No, she’s not. She’s the most popular girl at school and the leader of the in-crowd. If she so much as talks to you, you’re in. But if she gives you the cold shoulder, you’re out. You’re nobody.

Grant: That’s ridiculous. She only has the power to do that because you all worship her. One of these days, I hope somebody takes her down a peg.

Rosa: But nobody would dare to go against Joanna. It would be the end of their social life.

Grant: So what?

Rosa: So what?! I should know better than to talk about it with a clueless guy!

### 0991 Describing Distances

Sandra: Where will we be staying when we visit Trumanville?

Roger: We’ll be staying in a neighborhood on the outskirts of the town, but a stone’s throw from some of the major sites we’ll want to see.

Sandra: I hope there’ll be a lot of taxis around. You know I hate to walk.

Roger: Trumanville is a very walkable city, and we’ll be within walking distance to everything. We’ll be able to go nearly everywhere on foot.

Sandra: I told you. I hate to walk. At least we’ll be within close proximity to the beach.

Roger: Actually, the areas near the beach are too expensive, and we can’t afford it. And plus, the beach is in a remote part of town, and staying there would mean being in the boonies for our entire trip.

Sandra: But we could take taxis.

Roger: Taking taxis everywhere would be really expensive.

Sandra: Tell me that we’ll at least be in the vicinity of good shopping areas.

Roger: It might be a bit of a hike to the shops, but it won’t be too onerous to walk.

Sandra: Read my lips. I don’t want to walk everywhere. Maybe we can rent a car or hire a driver.

Roger: Are you out of your mind?! This is supposed to be a budget vacation, not a luxury trip. I’m not made of money, you know.

Sandra: And I didn’t know you were such a cheapskate!

### 0992 Loan Forgiveness Programs

Martin: One hundred eleven days and counting.

Georgina: Are you counting down to something?

Martin: I’m counting down to the day when my student loans will be discharged. I only took this job because it qualifies for the loan forgiveness program.

Georgina: But you’ve worked here for over two years already. You mean you’ve been working to pay off your student loans all this time?

Martin: That’s right. I took out loans to subsidize my college education. After I graduated, I had a choice to either start repaying the loans or work in a public service job for three years.

Georgina: Three years is a long commitment.

Martin: You’re telling me, but I had no choice. It was either that or be indebted for the next 10 to 15 years. I couldn’t take that.

Georgina: Now I get it.

Martin: Get what?

Georgina: I’ve noticed you’ve been happier lately and I thought you were finally enjoying your work here, but now I know it’s because you’re getting closer to getting out from under your loans.

Martin: That’s right. In less than four months I’ll be free at last, free at last!

### 0993 Doing Spring Cleaning

Malcolm: Do we really need to start doing spring cleaning today?

Lorna: We really should. The drapes need to be washed, the walls need to be wiped down, and the attic needs cleaning out. And we really should clean the upholstery on the sofa and dining chairs.

Malcolm: That’s a lot of work for two people.

Lorna: And I haven’t even mentioned what needs to be done in the kitchen. We need to defrost the freezer, clean the oven, clean out the cabinets, and scrub the floors.

Malcolm: I’m not sure I have the energy for all that.

Lorna: We also need to wash the windows, window screens, and windowsills, steam clean the carpets, and sweep out the garage.

Malcolm: If we hope to do all of that this weekend, then I think we need reinforcements.

Lorna: What do you have in mind?

Malcolm: I’m not the high school football coach for nothing.

Lorna: You mean . . .?

Malcolm: I think the guys need an extra-hard workout this weekend.

### 0994 Describing Accuracy and Inaccuracy

Rona: This is impossible. I’m never going to hit the target. Why is it that I’m the only one in this archery class who has no aim?

Leonardo: You’re doing fine. I can tell you’re new to this. It takes some practice to develop any precision.

Rona: But you seem to be picking it up quickly.

Leonardo: I’m taking this class as a refresher. My father taught me the rudiments of archery when I was a kid, and I thought I would take it up again.

Rona: You’re really good. You’ve hit the bullseye three times already.

Leonardo: I’m using a much more forgiving bow than you are. If I aim for the target, I can usually get the arrow in the neighborhood of the bullseye.

Rona: You’re just trying to make me feel better. I’m hitting wide of the mark every time!

Leonardo: I think your arms are too tense and that tension is ruining your accuracy. Here, let me help you.

Rona: Watch out. With my aim, I could take you out.

Leonardo: I’ll take my chances.

### 0995 Proper Behavior at a Formal Event

Rodney: Ha-ha! Did you hear what I said? Funny, right?

Samantha: Behave yourself! This is a serious and solemn occasion, not a time for levity.

Rodney: Loosen up. We have to endure two hours of this ceremony.

Samantha: It’s indecent the way you’re behaving. Don’t you have any sense of decorum?

Rodney: Lighten up. You’re such a stick-in-the-mud. There’s nothing unseemly about cracking a few jokes when everybody here is taking themselves too seriously.

Samantha: Your problem is that you have no sense of dignity. Don’t you realize that your stupid jokes cheapen the occasion? You’re a disgrace.

Rodney: Don’t get all huffy. All right, if you won’t join in, I’ll try to be serious.

Samantha: That’s better.

Rodney: I would seriously like a drink. Bartender!

Samantha: [Groans]

### 0996 Importing Goods to the U.S.

Daniel: You look like you’re sitting on pins and needles.

Muriel: I am. I’m waiting to hear if our goods have cleared customs yet. We’re in big trouble if our 50 crates aren’t released soon.

Daniel: You’ve filled out the proper paperwork. What could go wrong?

Muriel: You have no idea how much red tape there is when importing goods to the U.S. There are all kinds of rules to follow, and we have to pay the correct tariffs.

Daniel: But I thought we had a free-trade agreement with Niebuhrland. All goods imported from and exported to Niebuhrland should be duty-free.

Muriel: Most things are duty-free, but not everything. There are tariffs on spirits, and the tax rate varies depending on the type of spirits. It’s all very confusing.

Daniel: Well, sitting here fretting won’t do any good.

Muriel: If only I had access to those 50 crates of spirits . . .

### 0997 Writing One’s Memoirs

Oscar: We’re thrilled that you’ll be publishing your memoir with our company. You’ve had such an interesting life. I’m sure you’ll have lots of titillating stories to tell.

Liz: Well, my memoir will certainly have a lot of stories about my career: the people I’ve worked with and the kindness I’ve encountered in this industry.

Oscar: That’s nice, but people buy autobiographical books for the juicy details, the more salacious, the better.

Liz: I was really thinking of focusing on the people who helped me in my career and their selflessness.

Oscar: But I thought you were interested in writing a tell-all book. Considering how many times you’ve been married and the affairs you’ve had, you must have lots of steamy stories.

Liz: I don’t want to be telling tales about people I love or once loved. I want to focus on the positive.

Oscar: You could do that, but your books won’t fly off the shelves without those juicy details.

Liz: Really?

Oscar: Really.

Liz: Maybe I could tell one or two scandalous stories.

Oscar: Now you’re talking.

Liz: There was that infamous party where a cat fight broke out between . . .

### 0998 Meeting a New Neighbor

Nancy: Hello there! Hello!

Eric: Hello.

Nancy: I’m Nancy, your neighbor across the street. You’re new to the neighborhood.

Eric: Yes, I just moved in last weekend.

Nancy: That’s nice. How are you settling in?

Eric: Fine, thanks.

Nancy: Would you like to come over and have a cup of coffee? I can give you the scoop on the neighborhood and give you some tips on places to go and things to do in this area.

Eric: Thanks, but I’m kind of busy right now. I’ll take a rain check.

Nancy: No problem. Stop by anytime. We have quite a few social events in the area that you might be interested in.

Eric: I’m not much of a joiner. I tend to keep to myself.

Nancy: Oh, but we couldn’t let you do that. I’m appointing myself your new social secretary. As a new resident in a small town, you should know that everyone will want to meet you. You’ll be inundated with invitations. I can help you sort them out.

Eric: I appreciate your offer, but if I have to fend off neighbors, I’ll do it myself.

Nancy: Well, suit yourself. I don’t recommend turning down too many invitations, or you’ll get a reputation for being a recluse.

Eric: That’s okay with me. I’d rather not be the subject of talk among the busybodies.

Nancy: Busybodies! Well, some people!

### 0999 Being Vague and Unfocused

Thierry: I’m pumped and ready to help paint the community center this weekend. What time are we supposed to get there in the morning?

Bonnie: I’m not sure. Sophia was a little vague about that. She told people to show up when they can make it.

Thierry: That doesn’t sound like an auspicious start. How many people are supposed to be there?

Bonnie: I’m a little fuzzy on that, too. Sophia didn’t have a sign-up sheet. She just told people to show up if they could.

Thierry: I hate to say it, but Sophia is the worst person to be organizing this. Her heart is in the right place, but her head is in the clouds. I don’t think I’ve ever met a more absentminded person.

Bonnie: I know what you mean. She always seems to be daydreaming.

Thierry: I’m going to call her right now and pin her down. She needs to attend to the nitty-gritty if this is project is going to get done.

Bonnie: What if she’s as vague as she usually is?

Thierry: I’ll try speaking to her on a different frequency: Earth to Sophia, Earth to Sophia . . .

### 1000 Reaching a Milestone

Jeff: Well, we’ve reached a milestone.

Lucy: Yup, it’s been a long haul, but we’ve finally made it. Did you ever think we’d get here?

Jeff: I admit I had my doubts. At the beginning, I was really dubious that this venture would pan out. I thought that our prospects were iffy, at best.

Lucy: Me, too. We didn’t have an auspicious start, but we had a turning point after a few months of grinding out the work, day in and day out.

Jeff: So, what should we do now?

Lucy: I think we both deserve a celebratory drink, a toast to our achievements . . . so far.

Jeff: That sounds good. Then what?

Lucy: Put our noses back to the grindstone?

Jeff: I was afraid you were going to say that!

### 1001 Practicing Yoga

Victor: Humph!

Rosaria: What’s the matter?

Victor: I just got back from my first yoga class and I was sorely disappointed.

Rosaria: I’ve heard that yoga is very good low-impact exercise and helps with stress relief. It’s supposed to calm the mind and strengthen the body.

Victor: Yeah, right.

Rosaria: It sounds like you had a bad experience. Did you have a bad teacher?

Victor: The teacher was fine. I learned about mantras and chakras, I learned breathing techniques, and I tried a few basic poses.

Rosaria: That all sounds right from my own experience, such as it is. But, there are a lot of different types of yoga. Maybe you need to try a different kind.

Victor: The problem wasn’t the kind of yoga being practiced. It was the class.

Rosaria: Were the mats uncomfortable?

Victor: No.

Rosaria: Was it too cramped?

Victor: No.

Rosaria: Then what was the problem?

Victor: There was too much testosterone in the room.

Rosaria: You mean you were in a class with just men?

Victor: Yeah.

Rosaria: And that was a problem?

Victor: Do you think I would be taking a yoga class if I weren’t trying to meet women?!

### 1002 An Unwelcome Business in the Neighborhood

Patricia: Finally! That empty building has a new tenant. That’s great for the neighborhood.

Francois: Think again. The new tenant plans to open a strip club.

Patricia: A strip club in the middle of a residential neighborhood?! That must be a violation of city ordinances. The city won’t allow that.

Francois: I’m not so sure. The tenant has already started moving in, and there is no sign that the city is going take action.

Patricia: Then we have to do something to let the city know that we object to a strip club going into that space.

Francois: Good luck getting the city to do anything, much less file an injunction. The mayor is very pro-business, and it won’t look good if he tries to shut down any business that could bring revenue and jobs to this dying town.

Patricia: But at what cost? Our kids will have to walk past the strip club every day to and from school. That’s outrageous!

Francois: I suggest channeling that energy into action. If we make a stink and get media coverage, maybe we’ll get some action.

Patricia: Good idea. How can we get the local media to cover a neighborhood protest?

Francois: How about nude picketing?

Patricia: I think that would send the wrong message.

### 1003 Describing Duration

Kathryn: Are you still watching that movie? It’s been over three hours!

Martin: Yeah, it’s a little long for a feature film.

Kathryn: A little long?! It’s interminable. How can you continue to watch it?

Martin: Well, the first half was interesting and moved at a clip. The middle section did drag a little, but it’s picked up again. It’s nearly over.

Kathryn: I would’ve turned it off long before this. I like movies that are short and sweet. After about 90 minutes, my mind starts to wander, and after two hours, I check out.

Martin: It depends on the movie. Sometimes I watch a movie and it’s so engrossing that time zips by. With other movies, though, time moves at a snail’s pace. This movie is somewhere in between.

Kathryn: Hey, the credits are rolling. You missed the ending.

Martin: No big loss. I knew how it was going to end after the first hour.

Kathryn: Then why did you stick it out and watch the rest of the movie?

Martin: One word: procrastination.

Kathryn: Ah, enough said.

### 1004 Being Modest and Boastful

Hans: Well, I think the choice is clear. I think we should hire Clark.

Freddie: To me, the choice is clear, too, but I think that choice is Paul. Both Paul and Clark are qualified for the job, but Clark is a blowhard. He was too full of himself.

Hans: Clark may come off as a little overconfident, but he makes a good impression. He would make a much better rep than Paul. Paul was just too low-key and timid.

Freddie: Paul wasn’t timid at all. He was modest and self-deprecating, but he also had a quiet confidence. He wasn’t trying too hard to impress, like Clark was.

Hans: Clark is the kind of person who stands out in a room and gets noticed. That’s what we want in a rep trying to get new clients.

Freddie: I found Clark to be overbearing. Paul, on the other hand, had a way with him. He exuded confidence without having to resort to blowing his own horn.

Hans: I see we’re at loggerheads about this. What do you suggest?

Freddie: Let’s ask them both to lunch and ask Monique to join us. She’s done a lot of hiring and has good judgment.

Hans: You mean you want Monique to make the call so neither of us will be blamed for picking the wrong person.

Freddie: I always thought you were quick on the uptake.

### 1005 Complimenting Your Host

Anton: Jenny, you’ve outdone yourself. This is quite a spread.

Jenny: Thank you. I’m glad you approve.

Anton: Approve? I think everything on this table looks exquisite and mouthwatering.

Jenny: That’s nice of you to say. I wanted everything to be perfect.

Anton: You’ve surpassed all expectations. If this food tastes even half as good as it looks, you’ll wow every guest.

Jenny: If you don’t stop complimenting me, I won’t be able to stop blushing.

Anton: I’m only just beginning, because you’re a vision in that dress.

Jenny: Oh, this is nothing special.

Anton: Of course it’s special, but you could wear a sack and look ravishing.

Jenny: Okay, now I know you’re buttering me up. What gives?

Anton: Nothing, nothing at all. You’re so suspicious. I’m just giving you my candid opinion.

Jenny: If you say so. Where’s the camera you borrowed from me for your trip? Did you bring it?

Anton: Ah, the camera. Did I mention how much I admire that necklace you’re wearing?

### 1006 Taking a Campus Tour

Ji Won: Come on, Dad, the campus tour starts over there. The guide is ready to begin the walking tour.

Guide: Welcome, prospective students and your parents. My name is Jaime and I’ll be conducting your tour today. This tour will last about an hour, and we’ll be making frequent stops so I can point out some of the most important buildings and areas on this campus.

Ji Won: Dad, are you listening?

Guide: First, let’s stop on the quad. On your left, you’ll see the administration building. On your right are the student union and bookstore. Let’s continue.

Ji Won: Dad, stop checking your email. You promised that you’d make these campus visits with me and help me make a decision about which university to attend.

Guide: We’re passing the sports stadium on your left and the arts complex on your right. Those buildings there are the dorms. The research library is just ahead.

Ji Won: Dad, where did you go?

Guide: Let’s stop here a moment so I can point out the science buildings and research labs. Is something the matter?

Ji Won: I think I’ve lost my dad. I think we’ll have to take the self-guided tour!

### 1007 Getting Mugged

Vanessa: Stop thief!

Police Officer: What happened?

Vanessa: I just got mugged. That guy stole my purse, jewelry, camera – all of my valuables!

Police Officer: Were you wearing flashy jewelry and carrying an expensive camera? Those are big enticements for muggers.

Vanessa: I didn’t have anything on that was flashy, and I was minding my own business.

Police Officer: Well, you should never go out alone at night, and if you have to, stay in well-lighted areas. Traveling on dim streets makes you a target for thieves.

Vanessa: Thanks for that insight.

Police Officer: Can you describe the person who mugged you?

Vanessa: No, it happened in a flash. I didn’t get a good look at his face, but I’m sure it was a man.

Police Officer: It’s a good thing you weren’t hurt. You should probably learn self-defense in case it happens again.

Vanessa: Thanks a lot. I think I’ve had as much advice as I can take in one night. Are you going to do anything to find that mugger?

Police Officer: Sure, I’ll file a report, but don’t get your hopes up.

Vanessa: Believe me, I won’t.

### 1008 Money Laundering

Susanna: What’s going on in the office next door? I heard that the police shut down their business.

Clark: You heard right. The cops had long suspected that the business operating out of that office wasn’t legit.

Susanna: Not legit?

Clark: Yeah, it was a front for money laundering. The so-called services it offered were a sham. It was a way for people to send them dirty money and for the business to legitimize those funds.

Susanna: But who was involved?

Clark: I’m not sure, but I imagine they’re people who want to evade taxes or to circumvent certain laws or regulations. I wouldn’t be surprised if their clients were people with underworld connections.

Susanna: You mean organized crime?

Clark: Yeah, they’re probably drug lords, smugglers, and racketeers.

Susanna: Wow, and the people who helped them were working next door to us all that time.

Clark: And we didn’t know a thing about it. How awful.

Susanna: How exciting!

### 1009 Basic Military Commands

Marta: What’s going on out here? What’s all that noise?

Bruno: I’m putting the troops through their drills.

Marta: Troops?!

Bruno: Watch this. Hey, I didn’t tell you you could be at ease. Attention! Fall in. Forward, march!

Marta: That’s great, but . . .

Bruno: I’m not done. Let me show you what else these troops can do. Halt! About face!

Marta: Don’t you think that it’s time to . . .?

Bruno: March, march! Double time!

Child: Wah! [Child crying loudly.]

Marta: Come here. Did you fall down and hurt yourself? It’s okay. Everything’s going to be okay.

Bruno: Hey, there’s no crying in the military. Don’t coddle the troops, Marta.

Marta: Bruno, your twins are five years old. Don’t you think they’re a little too young to be going to boot camp?

Bruno: No, it’s never too young to instill discipline. Okay troops, fall in. Mark time! Now march, march, march . . .

### 1010 Using GPS When Driving

Justin: Okay, we’re ready. Let’s get on the road.

Fay: Wait! We don’t know where we’re going. We’re strangers in a strange land. Where’s our guide?

Justin: We don’t need a guide. See this? It’s GPS and it’ll help us navigate to where we want to go.

Fay: I’m not sure it’s reliable. We’re in a pretty remote location.

Justin: Relax and let me explain how this works: GPS systems use satellites to locate your current location. Information is transmitted to this receiver, so it always knows exactly where we are. We input the address of our destination and presto! It gives us onscreen or voice directions.

Fay: I know how a GPS system works. I’m worried that there aren’t reliable maps to where we want to go. I read that many printed maps of this region are outdated and unreliable.

Justin: Don’t worry. This GPS is the state-of-the-art. I’m sure it’ll be accurate.

Fay: A fool with a tool is still a fool.

Justin: What did you say?

Fay: Nothing.

### 1011 Building with Wood and Metal

Hugo: Wow, when you said that you did some woodworking on the weekends, I thought you meant refinishing furniture. But this! This is a real workshop and you’re actually building furniture.

Shawna: Yeah, this is what I’m working on right now. I’m building a dining table and chairs.

Hugo: The grain is beautiful on this piece of hardwood. It certainly looks better than the plywood furniture I have in my house. What is all this?

Shawna: Just some basic tools: saws, chisels, and drills.

Hugo: And what is all this metal for?

Shawna: I’m adding some grillwork for the back of the chairs. I don’t usually do metalwork, but I’m keeping it simple.

Hugo: This doesn’t look simple. These pieces have been welded together, and is that used for soldering?

Shawna: You got it. When all is said and done, I’ll have a new dining room set with a large table and eight chairs.

Hugo: Wow, I’m impressed.

Shawna: Want to try your hand at it?

Hugo: No thanks. You see these 10 fingers? I’m rather fond of them.

### 1012 Preventing Shoplifting

Luis: Wow, what happened here? I was only away on vacation for two weeks.

Thelma: While you were gone, we redesigned this store with an anti-theft system.

Luis: Is that why there are surveillance cameras and security guards everywhere?

Thelma: That’s right. We’re losing too much money to shoplifters, and I’m finally doing something about it. From now on, it’s zero tolerance. I don’t care if they’re petty thieves or kleptomaniacs. I’m rooting out every instance of shoplifting and prosecuting to the full extent of the law.

Luis: What are all these cases for?

Thelma: I’m putting the pricier merchandise under lock and key, and I’ve put security tags on most other items. I’m weighing whether to do exit inspections. I don’t want to go overboard.

Luis: [sighs] No, you wouldn’t want to do that.

### 1013 Living With a Hoarder

Julio: Mom, don’t you think it’s time to get rid of some of the stuff in this house?

Mom: Why? This house is fine the way it is.

Julio: There are parts of this house that are nearly inaccessible. There are stacks of magazines and bags and boxes everywhere.

Mom: I need all that stuff. You know I’ve always been a pack rat.

Julio: I know, but I think things are getting out of hand. You have stuff on every surface and you can’t find anything in here.

Mom: You can’t find anything, but I can put my hands on anything I want at any time. I collect and keep useful things, unlike you young people these days who throw away perfectly good things just because you don’t need them this minute.

Julio: I think your hoarding is becoming compulsive.

Mom: That’s nonsense. Just because you prefer living in a sterile environment doesn’t mean I have to. I don’t mind a little clutter.

Julio: A little clutter?! You have junk mail from 15 years ago!

Mom: You never know when something will come in handy. Now, don’t you have some room in your garage where I can store a few extra boxes?

Julio: No, I don’t!

### 1014 Becoming a Spy

Vaughn: You’ve been reading that novel for hours. What is it?

Sydney: It’s a spy novel and it’s really good. It’s about a man who is recruited by the C.I.A. to work in counterintelligence doing code breaking, but he becomes embroiled in the world of espionage.

Vaughn: That sounds exciting.

Sydney: Yeah, he’s sent on a mission to infiltrate a foreign spy organization and to feed them misinformation. I’d love to be a spy.

Vaughn: You wouldn’t really want to live the life of a spy, would you? You’d have to live a double life, not being able to tell your friends and family that you’re an operative.

Sydney: I wouldn’t care if I could go on clandestine missions to thwart and sabotage the enemy. Working for the C.I.A. would be a dream come true.

Vaughn: You’d have to keep a lot of secrets, not divulging classified information.

Sydney: Yes, so?

Vaughn: Loose lips sink ships.

Sydney: What are you trying to say?

Vaughn: Well, no offense, but I think your cover would be blown after about five minutes!

### 1015 Conducting a Search

Security Chief: Okay, people. We’ve just had a report of a missing child on this property. We need to find him fast. I want you two to search every room in this building. Look in every nook and cranny.

Ramona: Excuse me, may I ask a question?

Security Chief: You can when I’m done. Now you two, I want you to look all over the grounds. Make sure you check in the undergrowth and in the trees, and cover the entire terrain.

Ramona: Do you mind if I ask . . .?

Security Chief: I’ll stay here to coordinate the search. Report in if you see anything that could point us in the right direction.

Ramona: I really think I should tell you . . .

Security Chief: Don’t interrupt, please. The rest of you: Spread out and look in the parking lot and behind the buildings. Look high and low. We’ll search this place from top to bottom and leave no stone unturned. Now, are there any questions?

Ramona: Yes, is the little boy about five years old with brown hair and glasses?

Security Chief: Yes, that’s right. How did you know?

Ramona: Don’t look now, but he’s just about to walk off with your Taser!

### 1016 Doing Pro Bono Work

Claire: Welcome to the firm. Are you getting the hang of things here?

Jack: I am. I worked in another firm for two years before coming here, so I have some experience under my belt. But let me ask you one thing: Is the firm serious about wanting each person to do five hours of pro bono work each month?

Claire: It is. This firm takes community service very seriously. Everyone does pro bono work, and everybody is expected to hit the target of 60 hours each year.

Jack: This is so different from my previous firm. There, everything was about billable hours. Nobody cared about anything but how many hours we could rack up with each client.

Claire: Billable hours are important here, too, but we bill ourselves as the firm with a social conscience. That’s what sets us apart from our competitors. If you fall short of your expected pro bono hours, believe me, you’ll hear about it.

Jack: It’s refreshing to work for a firm that’s not all about the bottom line.

Claire: Don’t get carried away. This firm is still here to make money. It’s just not 100 percent of its focus.

Jack: Maybe just 98 percent?

Claire: That’s right. And in this industry, that’s unheard of.

### 1017 Driving an Off-Road Vehicle

Claudia: When you invited me to go for a drive, this wasn’t what I pictured.

Jae: You’re about to have the ride of your life. Get in and I’ll strap you in.

Claudia: What is this thing?

Jae: It’s an off-road vehicle. Haven’t you seen one before? It has four-wheel drive and can travel on any terrain.

Claudia: When you say “any terrain,” what exactly do you mean?

Jae: With this baby, we can drive on sand, gravel, mud, and even snow.

Claudia: You mean you intend to take me driving on sand and gravel?

Jae: Yeah, just wait until we start spinning and skidding. You’re going to love it. You’d better put on this crash helmet – just in case.

Claudia: I was picturing a drive in the country.

Jae: But this is much more exciting, right?

Claudia: I don’t know . . .

Jae: Come on. If you’re lucky, I’ll take you mudding next weekend.

Claudia: Whoopee.

### 1018 Raising Teenagers

Carl: Hi Marla, I’m really surprised to see you here. I didn’t know you had kids attending this high school.

Marla: I don’t – not yet. I heard about this meeting and decided to attend. It’s best to be ready for those teenage years, don’t you think?

Carl: Sure.

Marla: I heard that the principal is going to talk about different ways to handle our teenagers as they start asserting their independence. I want to be prepared.

Carl: That makes sense, I guess.

Marla: I mean, more and more teenagers are rebelling by getting tattoos and piercings and experimenting with drugs.

Carl: You’ve clearly done a lot of thinking about this.

Marla: I’ve read a few books on the topic, about kids having to deal with peer pressure. It’s my job as a parent to set boundaries and be stricter if it’s called for and ease up when my child needs space.

Carl: That’s all very insightful, but you have some time before all that comes into play, right?

Marla: My little Lucas is already four years old. Who knows when he might start hanging out with the wrong crowd and being led astray. A parent has to be vigilant.

Carl: Right.

### 1019 Losing a Passport While Traveling

Nina: Oh, my God! I can’t find my passport. I never should have put it in my purse. I’m sure a pickpocket took it.

Serge: Calm down. Maybe you just misplaced it. Let’s turn out all of your pockets and search for it before we panic.

Nina: I know it’s gone. I know it! Flag down the police. We have to file a police report.

Serge: If your passport has been stolen, we need to find the U.S. embassy.

Nina: We’re supposed to continue on to the next country on our tour tomorrow. We’re going to get left behind!

Serge: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. If we need to find a U.S. embassy and apply for a temporary passport, we’ll do that.

Nina: It’s Saturday! We won’t get any help at the embassy until Monday. We’ll be stuck here.

Serge: It’ll take as long as it takes. Now, let’s search through all of your belongings before we do anything else.

Nina: I just thought of something.

Serge: What?

Nina: I think I may have left it in the hotel room.

Serge: You think you may have left it in the hotel room.

Nina: Isn’t that good news? All that worry for nothing.

Serge: Let’s not count our chickens. You might have another inspiration.

### 1020 Making Verbal Mistakes

Omar: Ha-ha.

Faith: What’s so funny?

Omar: I’m editing Paul’s speech so that it can be posted on our website, but I didn’t realize how many verbal mistakes he made.

Faith: Were there a lot?

Omar: Yeah, he mispronounced the last name of the manager in charge of new products, for one. He also stumbled over the name of the new products.

Faith: I did notice that he had a few problems with delivery.

Omar: That’s putting it lightly. He stuttered when trying to list the products’ features. It’s true that some of the verbiage was written like tongue twisters, but I thought he would have had it down cold by now.

Faith: I noticed he made a few slips of the tongue, but I didn’t notice all that. I guess I wasn’t listening too closely. But what were you laughing about when I walked in?

Omar: Paul made a Freudian slip. Instead of saying that “innovation is our bread and butter,” he said that it was our “bed and butter.” Maybe that’s why he had so many flubs. His mind was elsewhere.

Faith: I think you’ll have plenty of material for a blooper reel.

Omar: That’s true. In fact, if this were a film, I’d have more outtakes than usable footage!

### 1021 Mental Disorders

Dr. Miao: At Berthiaume College, we take mental health issues very seriously. That’s why we have so many mental health services on campus.

Dean: Such as?

Dr. Miao: Well, for example, there is a meeting tonight of our support group for anorexics and bulimics. Tomorrow night, I’ll be speaking to a group of students about depression to make them aware of the warning signs.

Dean: Those are very important issues.

Dr. Miao: Yes, they are. In this student health center, we see cases ranging from social anxiety disorder to schizophrenia. In addition to serious mental disorders, college students are at risk of developing many types of antisocial behaviors resulting from the pressures of college and the stress of being on their own.

Dean: I know what you mean. One of my roommates copes with stress by binge drinking. My other roommate has become obsessive-compulsive. You should see how clean our apartment is.

Dr. Miao: And you? How have you been dealing with the stress?

Dean: Me? I think I’m the only well-adjusted one in the group.

Dr. Miao: Are you sure? You seem to have developed a nervous habit of pulling your hairs out one at a time.

Dean: What?! No, I haven’t.

Dr. Miao: Denying you have a problem is often a sign that you have a problem.

Dean: That’s crazy!

Dr. Miao: Shh! We don’t use the c-word here. Come with me.

### 1022 Being Cited for a DUI

Susan: Hey, Jack, you’re an attorney. Do you know anything about DUIs?

Jack: Sure, I’ve handled a few DUI cases.

Susan: I was just wondering about the penalties for a DUI.

Jack: Well, if it’s a first offense, you’ll be fined and may be placed on probation. You’ll need to attend DUI school, and your license will be restricted, which means you can only drive to and from work and to and from DUI school.

Susan: That sounds serious, but what if it’s not your first offense?

Jack: Then the penalties get even more serious. With your second offense, you’ll probably do mandatory jail time, anywhere from 96 hours to a year, depending on the circumstances. Your driver’s license will be suspended, and you’ll be placed on probation for several years.

Susan: Those are some severe penalties. But what if you already have two DUIs?

Jack: Then you’ll get several months in jail, at least. Your license will be revoked and you may be required to go into an alcohol treatment program. Why are you asking me all of these questions? You’re not in trouble, are you?

Susan: No, I’m not. I just met a guy and I really like him, but I think he just got his third DUI.

Jack: If that isn’t deterrent enough, you may think about what kind of relationship you can have with him – from behind bars!

### 1023 Learning to Act

Richard: It’s 6:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. Why are you banging those pots and pans?

Elizabeth: I have an audition coming up and I’m rehearsing.

Richard: By banging pots and pans?

Elizabeth: I’m up for a part as a 1950s housewife. I need to learn my lines and be prepared to improvise. That’s why I’m cooking you a 10-course breakfast. I want to practice staying in character.

Richard: I don’t really want a 10-course breakfast, but if it helps you with your audition...

Elizabeth: It will. I have to stretch my acting chops and really get into the head of the character.

Richard: Right. Whatever you say.

Elizabeth: “Yes, dear. Your breakfast will be ready and waiting when you want it.” Did I project enough? Did I emote enough?

Richard: You were great. What kind of acting job is this?

Elizabeth: It’s a small one.

Richard: In a film?

Elizabeth: No.

Richard: In a TV show?

Elizabeth: Not exactly.

Richard: What is it?

Elizabeth: It’s a commercial. It’s only a bit part, but you know what they say: “There are no small parts, only small actors!”

### 1024 Dealing with Crises

Teresa:Hey, where are you going?We have a meeting in 10 minutes.

Adrian:I’m sorry.I’m going to have to postpone.I’m in the middle of putting out fires, and I’ve had to clear my schedule to deal with the latest crisis.

Teresa:Can I help?

Adrian:I wish you could.With the new layoffs, I feel like I’m being pulled in several directions at once.As soon as I feel like I’m making headway with one problem, I get another thrown at me.

Teresa:I know exactly what you mean.I always feel like it’s crunch time around here because we’re so shorthanded.

Adrian:I’m so tired of everything being urgent all the time and needing attention ASAP.I long for the days when projects had timelines and people followed them.I’ve got to go.

Teresa:Hey, when are we going to have that meeting?

Adrian:As soon as things quiet down.

Teresa:When will that be?

Adrian:I’ll let you know as soon as the latest disaster has been averted.

### 1025 Maintaining Internet Privacy

Lorenzo: I wouldn’t post all of those photos on social media sites.

Pamela: Why not? Only my friends and family are going to see them.

Lorenzo: I wouldn’t be so sure. And I wouldn’t post all of that personal data either, or divulge personal information. You don’t know who may gain access to your page.

Pamela: There are privacy safeguards on this website. I can block anyone I don’t know from getting access, so no one can see what I post without permission.

Lorenzo: Well, the people who run the website itself have access. They could track what you do and what you post, and extract data from your page to sell to third-party buyers.

Pamela: No, they can’t do that. I’d know if they were doing that.

Lorenzo: How?

Pamela: Well . . .

Lorenzo: As I said, that’s happening as we speak. And those are the legitimate uses of your information. Hackers can gain access, too, with malicious intent. They can do a lot of damage with the personal data you’ve posted.

Pamela: So, what should I do?

Lorenzo: Take down most of your posts and photos, at least the ones you wouldn’t want everyone to see.

Pamela: But that would mean no one would know anything about me. Worse yet, it would mean having a really boring page.

Lorenzo: It’s either risk being boring or risk an invasion of your privacy.

Pamela: Wow, what a dilemma!

### 1026 Marrying Young

Irene: Damon and his girlfriend just got engaged. They’re planning on getting married this summer.

Ken: They’re too young! Marrying young poses all kinds of problems.

Irene: Such as?

Ken: Such as the two of them lacking maturity. They may think it’s fun to play house right now, but they’re not prepared to face the realities and responsibilities of matrimony.

Irene: I think you’re selling them short. They’ve been dating for two years, and there’s no ideal age for marriage.

Ken: Yes, but we all know that marrying young will doom them to a life of regrets.

Irene: That’s a bit harsh, don’t you think? A lot of people who marry young have successful marriages. I like the idea of growing old with your spouse. You can reach many of life’s milestones together.

Ken: Like reaching the legal drinking age?

Irene: Don’t be facetious. Getting married will give them stability and someone to lean on. I think they’ll be great as a married couple.

Ken: Well, I hope they beat the odds . . . or at least learn a lot for their second marriages.

### 1027 Adding Condiments to Food

Orlando: Hand me that Worcestershire sauce.

Janine: Here. You’re not putting that on your burger, are you?

Orlando: No, I’m using it for my hot dog.

Janine: Wait. You’ve put ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and barbecue sauce on your burger, and now you’re going to put Worcestershire sauce on your hot dog?

Orlando: Sure, you’ve got to have Worcestershire sauce on your hot dog.

Janine: No, I don’t. I don’t know anybody else who puts Worcestershire sauce on their hot dogs.

Orlando: You’re missing out. I just need to add a little steak sauce, horseradish, tartar sauce, and a dab of chili sauce, and this hot dog is ready to eat.

Janine: That sounds disgusting! Is there anything you won’t put on your food?

Orlando: On this food? Maybe maple syrup.

Janine: What?! You’re the one missing out. Hand me that syrup.

Orlando: That is truly revolting!

Janine: To each his own.

### 1028 Describing Order and Sequence

Patrick: Okay, your first task is to put all of these files in order.

Maya: Wow, there must be hundreds of files in this storeroom. How am I supposed to organize them?

Patrick: Create a basic filing system. Put things in sequence. If they’re labeled with dates, put them in chronological order. If they’re labeled with names, put them in alphabetical order by last name.

Maya: Okay, but what about this file? It’s labeled with a four-digit number, but it’s not a date.

Patrick: Those are case numbers. Put those in ascending or descending numeric order, whichever makes sense.

Maya: But this file has letters followed by numbers.

Patrick: Then put those in alphanumeric order, first by letter and then by number. Simple, right?

Maya: Yeah, but have you ever considered a more random filing system, something that embraces chaos?

Patrick: No, I haven’t. If I wanted chaos, I’d just go home to my 11 children!

### 1029 Types of Vandalism

Jim: Did you hear what happened to the Romeros?

Helene: No, what?

Jim: They went on vacation for a week and vandals broke a couple of windows in the back of their house and tagged their living room walls with graffiti.

Helene: That’s terrible! There are always punks who like to egg houses in this neighborhood for fun, but this is much more serious.

Jim: I think things are getting out of hand. Every week or two, we hear of incidents of people having their tires slashed or their cars keyed.

Helene: And the Jamisons had their flowerbeds trampled and a small fire set on their lawn three weeks ago. This neighborhood is really going downhill.

Jim: What should we do about it?

Helene: What do you mean?

Jim: I think we should start patrolling the streets at night.

Helene: You mean organize a neighborhood watch? Wouldn’t that be dangerous?

Jim: If you’re worried, when you see something suspicious, call the police.

Helene: And you think they’ll come in time to catch them? The police aren’t known for quick response times in this neighborhood.

Jim: Then we’ll go after them ourselves.

Helene: You mean be vigilantes? I’m not sure that would be wise.

Jim: Why not? If Clint Eastwood can do it, so can I. Go ahead, punk, make my day!

### 1030 Adopting a Pet

Gabe: Why are we here? I thought we decided to put off getting a dog.

Rene: I know that’s what you’d like to do, but I thought a trip to the pound might convince you that this is the right time to adopt a dog. Look at this cute little dog. This card lists his breed and says that he was neglected and abandoned. How could you turn down a face like that?

Gabe: I don’t think he’s right for us. Let’s move on.

Rene: Look at this one. It says on his card that when they found him, he showed signs of abuse. Poor baby. How can you not be moved to take this little guy home?

Gabe: Let’s keep moving.

Rene: How about this little dog? I’d hate to see this little guy be put down. Here, pet her and look at her little face.

Gabe: This animal shelter isn’t going to put down these dogs. It’s a humane place.

Rene: They have no choice. They find so many strays that there’s no room to keep them. It’s so sad. It’s tragic, really.

Gabe: Maybe . . .

Rene: What did you say?

Gabe: I said maybe we could take one home, maybe two.

Rene: Really? Two would be great, but three would be better.

Gabe: Don’t push your luck!

### 1031 Following a High-Profile Court Case

Danny: Have you been following the Schirru case?

Carol: Yeah, I have. I think he’s guilty.

Danny: You’re kidding, right? He’s innocent and this is a show trial. The district attorney is conducting a witch-hunt for his own political ambitions.

Carol: No, he’s not. It is a high-profile case, but that’s only because he wants to make an example of Schirru. People like him should be off the streets. Putting him in jail sends a message to other criminals.

Danny: What kind of message?

Carol: The message that the government is cracking down.

Danny: I think it’s just grandstanding and Schirru is being made a sacrificial lamb.

Carol: You can believe what you like, but I think it’s great that the district attorney is taking a stand.

Danny: Yes, but he seems to be doing it at the expense of real justice.

Carol: Not from where I’m standing.

Danny: Then you need to find a new place to stand – preferably one without blind spots.

### 1032 Different Management Styles

Bianca: Today’s the day. We’re supposed to find out who the new manager is going to be. I hope they’re not making a mistake by hiring internally.

Conrad: I just hope they don’t pick Melissa. She would be a disaster.

Bianca: Why do you say that? I like Melissa.

Conrad: I like her, too, but she can be so autocratic. Give her a little power and it goes to her head. Every decision would be top-down.

Bianca: You might be right, but I think Quentin would be worse. He would be so laissez-faire that it would be like not having a manager at all. He’d delegate everything and then sit back and do nothing.

Conrad: I’ll grant you that. Quentin would be a horrible manager. What about Jemima? She’s popular with nearly everybody in the office.

Bianca: I suppose Jemima would be a bearable option. She likes to collaborate and often consults with other people to get their feedback. But I’m backing a different horse, one that would be the ideal.

Conrad: Who?

Bianca: You.

Conrad: Me? No way. I don’t have a chance in hell. And plus, how do you know I’d be a good manager?

Bianca: You’d be democratic in your decision making and I’d like that. You wouldn’t rule with an iron fist.

Conrad: That’s what you think. Give me a little power and you can start calling me commandant.

### 1033 Discussing a Victory or Loss

Yolanda: Did you see the game last night?

Bob: You mean the crushing victory of my team over yours?

Yolanda: That’s not how I would characterize it. We fell short in the final seconds, but we played a good game up until then.

Bob: In your dreams. My team dominated from beginning to end. You’re just lucky that it wasn’t a complete blowout.

Yolanda: We would have won if the coach hadn’t decided to throw in the towel early. I think he just melted down under the pressure.

Bob: It’s easy for you to play Monday morning quarterback, but I don’t think anything would have saved your team from going down in flames.

Yolanda: There’s a rematch in three weeks, you know.

Bob: And my team will whup your team again, no question.

Yolanda: You can trash talk all you like. We’ll see if you’re still smiling after my team wipes the floor with yours!

### 1034 Making Changes to a Hotel Reservation

Reservation agent: Hello, Milton Hotel reservations. How may I assist you?

Sally: Hi, I’m calling to make some changes to an existing reservation.

Reservation agent: Certainly. Do you have the reservation number?

Sally: Sure, it’s 234678.

Reservation agent: That’s a reservation for Sally Menkel. Is that right?

Sally: Yes, that’s right. I’d like to change the check-in date from September 15th to September 16th.

Reservation agent: Certainly. I can make that change for you. Is that the only change?

Sally: No, the check-out date will also change, from the 23rd to the 24th.

Reservation agent: No problem. We have you arriving on the 16th of September and departing the 24th of September. Will there be anything else?

Sally: Yes, there will be two people in my party, not just one.

Reservation agent: I’ve made that change. Anything else I can help you with?

Sally: Yes, instead of a courtyard room, I’d like a room with a view, preferably on an upper floor.

Reservation agent: I can certainly change that for you, although there will be a change in the room rate. The new rate is $189 per night.

Sally: On second thought, I’d prefer a suite that overlooks the pool. Is that possible?

Reservation agent: Certainly. The new rate is $249 per night.

Sally: Oh, that’s really expensive. I think I’d better to stick to my original room.

Reservation agent: All right. I’ve changed your reservation back to a courtyard room. Anything else?

Sally: Maybe I should shorten my stay. If I do that, I could afford a suite. Yes, let’s change the dates and the rooms again.

Reservation agent: Let me make a suggestion. Let’s cancel this reservation and make a whole new one. That way, we can make sure everything is correct.

Sally: Oh, that’s not too much trouble for you, is it? I’d hate to be a bother.

Reservation agent: No, no trouble at all.

### 1035 Using a Self-Checkout Machine

Claudia: We’re done, right? Let’s get in this cashier line.

Raul: No need. This store has self-checkout machines.

Claudia: I don’t know. I think it would be easier going through a cashier line.

Raul: Using the self-checkout will be much quicker. Let me show you. All you have to do is scan the bar codes on each grocery item.

Claudia: There are no bar codes on fruits and vegetables.

Raul: All you have to do is put them on the scale and find the product on the touch screen.

Claudia: You look. I’ll start bagging.

Raul: Wait! You’re supposed to wait until everything is scanned before removing items from the bagging area to put in bags. Oh no, now there’s a “see attendant” message on the screen.

Claudia: What do we do now?

Raul: We wait for the attendant to clear the error and void the transaction. Then we start again.

Claudia: Great. You’re right. This is much faster.

Raul: It is if you know what you’re doing.

Claudia: I’ll tell you what. I’ll take half of our groceries and stand in line and you use the self-checkout. We’ll see which is faster.

Raul: That’s a sucker bet. I have no doubt that I’ll be done before you are.

Claudia: I’m not worried. The last one out the door makes dinner.

Raul: You’re on. Just remember that I like my steak well done.

### 1036 Farming and Agribusiness

Brad: Is this your first visit to this area?

Irene: It is, and I’m surprised to see so many farms. I thought farming was a dying industry.

Brad: Family farms and small-scale farming are disappearing, but agribusiness is alive and well, thanks to government subsidies.

Irene: Are they lucrative?

Brad: They can be, but the subsidies were originally given to protect the livelihood of farmers.

Irene: And that’s not what’s happening?

Brad: Well, agribusiness has edged out small-scale farms because output is the name of the game. A lot of small-scale farmers have thrown in the towel.

Irene: That’s a shame, but the subsidies are still used to protect domestic food production, right?

Brad: That may be, but we’re losing a way of life. I come from a long line of farmers.

Irene: And you’re not farming?

Brad: Nope.

Irene: What do you do?

Brad: I work for the government agency that gives out subsidies to the very farms that put us out of business.

Irene: That’s quite a twist of fate.

Brad: You said it.

### 1037 Ending a Party

Gunther: I think this party has run its course, and I’m ready to call it a night.

Maria: But there are still a few stragglers who seem reluctant to leave. How do we politely tell them to go home?

Gunther: I’ll just make an announcement.

Maria: Wait! That seems kind of rude. Let me try a few hints. I’ll tell them that we’re out of drinks.

Gunther: If you do that, one of those guys is liable to offer to make a beer run. That’s not going to do the trick.

Maria: What if I go over there, yawn, and comment on the lateness of the hour? That should be obvious enough without being too rude.

Gunther: Those people aren’t going to respond to subtlety. Let me handle this.

Maria: What are you going to do?

Gunther: I’m going to do what bars do at closing time. I’m turning up the lights and turning off the music.

Maria: And if that doesn’t work?

Gunther: I’m going to yell “Lights out, people!” and mean it!

### 1038 Types and Characteristics of Apartments

Lily: Thanks for coming with me to meet the rental agent to view an apartment, but I think I’m lost. I’m supposed to be there in 10 minutes, but I can’t find it. There are four different apartment complexes located next to each other and they look identical.

Omid: Don’t you have the address?

Lily: Yes, but all of the complexes in this subdivision look the same, and I don’t see a street number on any of them.

Omid: Are you sure we’re looking for a block of apartments? Maybe the apartment is in a mixed-use building, like that one over there.

Lily: I’m pretty sure. At least I know it’s in a high-rise building and the apartment is on the eighth floor. That mixed-use building is only three stories high.

Omid: Oh, then it’s not a duplex or triplex, like those over there.

Lily: No, it’s definitely not one of those. I’d better call the rental agent and get directions.

Omid: Hey, look over there. I see a couple of the residents of that building walking out. Let’s ask them. Excuse me. Excuse me! Oh, they didn’t hear me.

Lily: I’ll just make the call.

Omid: Well, you can be sure of one thing if you move into one of these complexes.

Lily: What?

Omid: The bill collectors will never be able to find you!

### 1039 Taking a Test Drive

Mario: I’d like to test drive the new Racer.

Leah: Sure, all prospective buyers can take one of our cars for a test drive. May I see your driver’s license?

Mario: Here it is.

Leah: Okay, come with me. Why don’t you get into the driver’s seat and I’ll get into the passenger seat? All right, please buckle up and you can drive it around the block.

Mario: I think I may need to drive it a little farther to get a feel for the car.

Leah: That’s fine, but you’ll need to slow down!

Mario: Slow down? How will I know if this car is right for my driving style if I don’t put the pedal to the metal and put it through its paces?

Leah: I understand you want to get a complete driving experience, but unless you stop driving recklessly, we’ll need to return to the car lot.

Mario: You call this reckless? This isn’t reckless. It’s how I always drive. If you don’t hear the tires screeching, you’re not driving a car the way it should be driven.

Leah: Well, an interesting way of looking at it. Uh, I think we’d better head back to the car lot. I’m feeling a little nauseous.

Mario: Let me guess. You’ve never ridden in a car driven by a racecar driver before.

Leah: That’s right.

Mario: Then this is your lucky day!

### 1040 Dealing with Bureaucracy

Jogi: I knew when we got this government contract that it would be a two-edged sword.

Deborah: How so?

Jogi: I’m grateful for the work, but having to jump through hoops of the government’s bureaucracy has me pulling my hair out.

Deborah: What’s wrong now?

Jogi: You know that all of our documents have to be submitted in triplicate. I anticipated that and had done everything to the letter, or so I thought.

Deborah: I know. I helped you prepare those documents. What’s the problem?

Jogi: The documents were sent back to us because they say we didn’t follow some of the reporting regulations. But the verbiage in the regulations is so convoluted that I had to interpret them to the best of my ability. I thought I had done everything right.

Deborah: Didn’t they tell you what they thought was done wrong when they returned the documents?

Jogi: All I got was a form letter with no specifics.

Deborah: I suggest calling the office responsible for reviewing the documents and asking someone there.

Jogi: You don’t think I’ve tried? Each time I think I have the right department and leave a voicemail message, either I don’t hear back or I get palmed off on another office. I can’t get a straight answer to any of my questions. I never expected this much red tape.

Deborah: So I see what you mean about that two-edged sword.

Jogi: I can think of one good use for that sword right now – to put me out of my misery!

### 1041 Being Rescued

Irma: Do you really think we’ll be rescued? It’s been six hours and I’m losing hope.

Bert: It’s hard to say. I’m sure search and rescue teams are looking for us as we speak.

Irma: But what if they don’t come in time? We didn’t bring any provisions and we’re almost out of water.

Bert: You’re afraid of starvation and dying of thirst? I think we’d die from hypothermia or exposure to the elements first.

Irma: Thanks. I hadn’t thought of that until you mentioned it. Hey, I think that’s the sound of a helicopter.

Bert: You’re hearing things. That’s not a helicopter.

Irma: I think I hear search and rescue dogs. I think they’re onto our scent!

Bert: I think you’re starting to hallucinate. I don’t hear anything.

Irma: Can’t you just humor me? I’m trying to keep hope alive.

Bert: Oh, sure. Hey, I think I hear something.

Irma: You do?

Bert: Yeah, it’s Santa Claus on his sleigh.

### 1042 Being Diagnosed With and Treated For Cancer

Vivian: Do you see this lump? I’m sure I have cancer.

Guy: Don’t jump to conclusions. It could be something completely benign.

Vivian: I know it’s not benign. It’s got to be a malignant tumor. The cancer is probably at stage two or three already. The oncologist will probably want to start me on radiation and chemotherapy right away.

Guy: You haven’t seen a single doctor yet and you’re already planning for the worst.

Vivian: Of course I am. I want to be mentally prepared for the bad news. The doctor will do a biopsy, but I already know what the results will be. I’m just hoping the prognosis will be good.

Guy: I think you’re getting way ahead of yourself. It could be something completely harmless.

Vivian: I can’t afford to believe that. I have a family history of cancer. My father was diagnosed when he was 56 years old. It’s true he’s been in remission and hasn’t had a relapse yet, but you never know with cancer.

Guy: That’s right, you never know. You could live to the age of 90.

Vivian: You can fool yourself as much as you like, but I have to face facts – especially as sick as I am.

### 1043 TV Shows Being Renewed and Cancelled

Mo: I have some bad news: Your favorite TV show has been cancelled.

Amy: I’m not surprised. Ratings plummeted last season, so the writing was on the wall.

Mo: Also on the chopping block is your favorite reality show: American Idiots.

Amy: Oh no, not American Idiots, too! I thought it was gaining ground in the ratings after a slow start.

Mo: Unfortunately, it stayed a cult favorite and never garnered a large enough viewership to be renewed.

Amy: I’ll have nothing to watch next season.

Mo: You can watch some of my shows. All of my favorites are being renewed, with one taking a short hiatus.

Amy: A short hiatus? We all know what that means.

Mo: What are you implying?

Amy: The network will put in a mid-season replacement, and if it does well, you’ll never see your show again.

Mo: That’s not true. You’re just saying that because your shows got the ax.

Amy: No, I’m not. That show is on its last legs. Mark my words.

Mo: Well, even if it’s true, I still have something to watch, for now.

Amy: What are you watching right now?

Mo: A show called Podsters. It’s a reality show where a bunch of podcasters live in a house together and are watched 24 hours a day.

Amy: I’ve never heard of anything so inane. Who cares about the lives of podcasters? They must be the most boring people in the world.

Mo: You might have a point there.

### 1044 Issuing a Public Apology

Working in public relations, I often have to deal with my clients’ gaffes and blunders. My job is to calm any firestorm before it gets out of hand.

One of the most important things to do whenever there’s been a misstep is to issue a public apology. An apology should say plainly and clearly that the individual or company is sorry and that it takes responsibility for its actions. If possible, the apology should outline corrective actions that will be taken. The key is to come clean, apologize, and take the blame, and to do so quickly and without hesitation.

I give my clients this advice every time they land themselves in a mess, but do they listen to me? The smarts ones do.

And the others? Many of them are still trying to salvage their reputations and to bounce back. And me? I try very hard not to say “I told you so.”

### 1045 Being Infatuated With Someone

Marcel: What is this on your wall?

Fiona: It’s my tribute to Del Gordon, my favorite player.

Marcel: This isn’t a tribute. It’s a shrine!

Fiona: It’s not a shrine. I just have a few pictures of him taped on my wall.

Marcel: You have poster-size pictures of him covering three walls of your room. This goes beyond being a fan. You’re obsessed with him.

Fiona: No, I’m not obsessed. I admit that I’m a little infatuated with him, but it’s a healthy kind of adulation.

Marcel: You’ve definitely gotten carried away.

Fiona: Just a little. I’m devoted to watching him play in every game and I try to find out as much as I can about him, but it’s because I admire him. It’s not like I’m stalking him or something.

Marcel: Then why do you have all of this equipment?

Fiona: That’s in case there’s a sighting of him in this city.

Marcel: A sighting?

Fiona: Yes, there’s a network of fans that keeps tabs on him, and if I learn that he’s in town, I can try to get a photo with him.

Marcel: And what are those handcuffs for?

Fiona: I only have those in case he doesn’t cooperate.

Marcel: You’re right. Your infatuation is completely healthy!

### 1046 Types of Luggage

Driver: Ma’am, where would you like these suitcases?

Leona: The three wheeled suitcases should go next to the bed, and the garment bag should be hung up in the closet. Where is my expandable bag?

Driver: Do you mean this duffel bag?

Leona: Yes. You can leave that right there. Hmm, where is my carry-on? All I see is my checked baggage. I thought I gave you my carry-on, too.

Driver: You did, ma’am, and it’s right here.

Leona: Oh, good. When can I expect my trunk to arrive?

Driver: Your trunk? You had a trunk?

Leona: Yes, I had a trunk. Didn’t you see it at the airport?

Driver: Uh no, I must have overlooked it.

Leona: You mean you left behind my trunk?! Who knows what has become of it by now!

Driver: I’m sure I’ll be able to find it and deliver it here to you.

Leona: I knew I should have used a luggage forwarding service.

Driver: You might consider traveling light next time, ma’am.

Leona: What did you say?!

Driver: Nothing! I’m going to fetch your trunk as we speak.

Leona: I should hope so!

### 1047 Having Breathing Problems

Russ: Why are you wheezing like that?

Cheryl: I’m not wheezing. I’m just a little short of breath. My lungs feel like they’ve closed up.

Russ: Maybe you should get that checked out. You could have asthma.

Cheryl: Do you really think so? My nasal passages have been stopped up, so I just thought I had a bad cold. My sinuses hurt, too.

Russ: I’m not a doctor, but you may have something more serious, maybe bronchitis or pneumonia. You need a chest x-ray or something.

Cheryl: Wow, so this could be something really serious?

Russ: Why do you sound hopeful that you have a serious condition?

Cheryl: I’m not. That would be stupid.

Russ: And yet, you sounded positively giddy that you might be laid up for a couple of weeks. Does this have anything to do with your upcoming business trip to Abrahamville?

Cheryl: If you had to go to Abrahamville, wouldn’t you wish for an out, too – any out?

### 1048 Launching an Initial Public Offering

Zoe: What are you looking at?

Midas: It’s the prospectus for Boogle’s IPO. I wish I could get in on the initial public offering, but since I can’t, I’ll buy stock as soon as the company becomes publicly traded.

Zoe: I’m not really familiar with how the stock market works. You mean you’re going to buy shares in Boogle?

Midas: That’s right. An IPO is a way for a privately owned company to become a publicly owned one. The owners of the company do it to raise capital, or sometimes it’s for early investors to cash in.

Zoe: Why can’t you buy stock in the initial public offering?

Midas: A company like Boogle works with an underwriter, like a major investment bank, to help set the share price and to find buyers for the initial offering.

Zoe: Okay, I’m following you so far.

Midas: Well, that first sale of stock is usually done in bulk, and I don’t have a few million dollars lying around to buy that much stock. Luckily for me, those first buyers then turn around and sell that stock in smaller amounts.

Zoe: And that’s when you’ll buy.

Midas: That’s right. You should get in on it, too.

Zoe: You mean buy some Boogle stock?

Midas: Sure, why not?

Zoe: And risk losing my shirt? No, thanks!

### 1049 Buying Theater Tickets

Susie: I can’t believe I’m going to get to see my favorite actor in a play. I want front row seats!

David: I’m looking at the venue’s seating plan right now, and all front row seats are taken for the entire run. I’m guessing that season ticket holders got those.

Susie: Damn! All right. Let’s try to get seats as close to the stage as possible, preferably in the orchestra.

David: The only orchestra tickets still available have partially obstructed views.

Susie: Okay, we’ll take those.

David: But we won’t be able to see the entire stage. These tickets in the loge or mezzanine, or even the balcony, will give us a better view of the play.

Susie: I don’t need to see every part of the play. I just want to get as close to him as possible.

David: Wait one second. I see two seats in the second row still available for the matinee performance. Oh no, those are seats for wheelchair access.

Susie: That’s great! We’ll take those.

David: But neither of us needs wheelchair access.

Susie: I’ll break a leg if I have to, to get that close to him.

David: Do the words “obsessed fan” mean anything to you?

Susie: You can call it obsession, but I call it devotion!

### 1050 Describing Stomach Problems

There’s nothing I enjoy more than spending a couple of hours relaxing at a café. I sit drinking my tea and reading. What could be better?

Woman: So I think I may have to see a doctor soon. You know I’ve had these terrible pains in my stomach. My digestion is terrible, and now I think I might have an ulcer!

Well, I was having a relaxing time until I started overhearing the woman at the next table talking loudly on her cell phone.

Woman: No, I don’t think it could be lactose intolerance. My bowels are working fine. I don’t have the runs or feel constipated. I just get a really upset stomach and these terrible pains.

This was definitely not a conversation I waned to listen to. I looked around for another table, somewhere I could escape to.

Woman: Yes, I do feel some heartburn and bloating. Do you really think it could be acid reflux? I do have a problem with too much gas and burping a lot. Will an antacid help, do you think?

By this time, I was in panic mode. If I didn’t get away from this woman soon, I’d surely be sick to my stomach!

### 1051 Getting and Making Threats

Ruth: I’m really glad you’re getting so much support from the public. Look at all of these bags of fan mail.

Carl: Only about half of that is fan mail. The rest is hate mail.

Ruth: Hate mail? Who would send you hate mail?

Carl: Lots of people. People who are disgruntled write to me about their grievances.

Ruth: Really?

Carl: Don’t look so surprised. We’ve gotten bomb threats, and I’ve even received a few death threats.

Ruth: Death threats?! Aren’t you worried about your personal safety?

Carl: Not really. Most people are just venting, and others are trying to intimidate me. I’m not going to buckle under just because I get a few letters.

Ruth: But it only takes one mentally unbalanced person to carry through on threats. Have you considered getting a bodyguard?

Carl: No, I don’t need any protection. I just need to keep plugging away and getting things done.

Ruth: I finally know what to get you for your birthday.

Carl: What?

Ruth: A bulletproof vest.

### 1052 A Product Recall

Melissa: This is a disaster! If we have to recall 100,000 units, we’ll take a huge loss this year.

Lee: We have no choice. The product defect poses a safety hazard. If we don’t act quickly, we’ll have a huge liability issue on our hands.

Melissa: I think we’re blowing this out of proportion. Only a small amount of our June product run was affected.

Lee: Yes, but even one case of someone getting hurt because of the defect would be a PR nightmare, and that’s on top of the charges of negligence we’d have to face in court. We need to get ahead of this now.

Melissa: All right, all right. I guess we have no choice. Should we hold a press conference to announce the recall?

Lee: We’ll send out a press release first and then hold a press conference.

Melissa: I’m putting you in charge of it. Get it done.

Lee: You mean in charge of getting the press release sent out?

Melissa: I mean that and the press conference. You can face the press and answer their questions.

Lee: You’re throwing me to the wolves?

Melissa: Not at all. I’m helping you raise your profile in the company. You should be thanking me.

Lee: Somehow I don’t feel so grateful.

### 1053 Buying Food at the Concession Stand

Jim: We only have three minutes before the movie starts. You grab two seats and I’ll hit the concession stand.

***

Suki: Can I help you?

Jim: Yes, I’d like a large popcorn and a hot dog with the works.

Suki: Anything else?

Jim: Yes, I’ll also take an order of nachos and a pretzel.

Suki: Sorry, we’re out of pretzels right now, but we have cotton candy, snow cones, and pizza.

Jim: All right, then give me a slice of pizza.

Suki: Will that be all?

Jim: No, I’d also like a box of licorice, a package of beef jerky, and an ice cream sandwich.

Suki: Anything to drink?

Jim: Yes, I’ll take two large sodas.

Suki: All right, that’ll be $84.50.

Jim: What?! That’s highway robbery!

Suki: Our prices are posted on the board. You can see them right up there. Do you still want all this?

Jim: Just give me the soda and popcorn.

Suki: Are you sure you’ll make it through the movie with just that?

Jim: I have no choice. I’d have to commit robbery if I wanted anything else!

### 1054 Finding a Roommate

Carlos: Now that your boyfriend has moved out, you need a roommate. There’s no way you can afford this apartment on your own.

Inez: I know, but I really don’t want to live with a stranger. I’d have to put up with all of their quirks.

Carlos: I don’t think you have a choice. You need someone to split the rent and the cost of utilities, not to mention your cable bill.

Inez: I’d need someone who could keep the common areas neat and clean and who can keep their hands off my stuff.

Carlos: I’m sure you’ll manage to find someone with those qualities.

Inez: They’d have to help with chores around the apartment, too, and pitch in with general upkeep.

Carlos: No doubt there’s someone out there who wouldn’t mind doing that.

Inez: Hey, aren’t you looking for a place to live? You could move in here.

Carlos: You mean share an apartment with you? No thanks.

Inez: Why not?

Carlos: I’d just rather not. I don’t think we’d suit.

Inez: Why wouldn’t we?

Carlos: Do you really want me to spell it out for you?

Inez: Yes, in fact, I insist.

Carlos: All right. Let’s just say that you’re a little bit grouchy in the mornings. You know that monster in the Alien movies?

Inez: Yes.

[silence]

Carlos: Ouch! Ouch! Stop hitting me!

### 1055 Riding Scooters and Motorcycles

Bernadette: When you offered to give me a ride to work, I didn’t know you rode a motorcycle. I’m not sure about this.

Pawel: Come on, put on this helmet and get on. You’ll get to work much faster. We can zip around cars and go between lanes.

Bernadette: That’s what I’m afraid of.

Pawel: I’m an experienced driver. I rode a moped when I was a teenager, had a scooter in college, and got my first bike when I was 22. I ride with my motorcycle club every weekend, so you don’t have to worry about safety.

Bernadette: I’m sure you’re a good driver, but one wrong move and I’m roadkill.

Pawel: Get on and I promise to behave. I won’t pop any wheelies, spin out, or do any other tricks.

Bernadette: If that was intended to put my mind at ease, it didn’t work.

Pawel: All right, last call. You want a ride to work or not?

Bernadette: Okay, I’m putting my life in your hands. If I die, it’ll be on your conscience.

Pawel: No worries. If we wipe out, it’ll take us both out, so I won’t be conscious to worry about my conscience. Hold on!

### 1056 Finding Emerging Markets

Jamie: If our company is going to grow, we need to find emerging markets. It makes sense to get a foothold in a few countries that may have developed markets within the next 20 years.

Nina: But there’s no guarantee that rapid growth in a country’s economy now will be sustainable years from now. I think it’s too much of a gamble myself.

Jamie: There are certainly no guarantees, but by the time it all shakes out and it’s clear which markets are the most promising, we will have missed the boat.

Nina: So what are you suggesting? Should we pick one or two markets to invest in, or hedge our bets and invest in several?

Jamie: I think we should identify the countries that have shown strong economic growth in the past 10 years and focus on those.

Nina: I still think it may be too risky, but I’m willing to consider the idea. Work up a proposal and I’ll look at it.

Jamie: You will? This is great. I didn’t think you’d be so receptive.

Nina: I’m not making any promises, but I’ll keep an open mind. Just make it short and sweet.

Jamie: Short and sweet is my middle name!

### 1057 Storing Food

Lee: Wow, what are we going to do with all these leftovers?

Sarah: Let’s store them in different containers and we can each take some to work to share. We won’t be able to eat all of this ourselves, and I don’t want it to go to waste.

Lee: Okay, I’ll get some plastic containers and sandwich bags for the cookies.

Sarah: Can you also grab some wax paper, too? We’ll need to put some between each brownie so they don’t stick together.

Lee: We’re not going to have enough plastic containers. How about wrapping up some of this food in Saran wrap or aluminum foil?

Sarah: Great idea. I think I have some freezer bags, too. We might as well freeze a couple of pieces of cake to eat later.

Lee: I wish we could vacuum seal them and store more pieces. That cake was really good!

Sarah: I know. I could eat three pieces in one sitting.

Lee: Hmm. On second thought, for the sake of our waistlines, maybe that wouldn’t be such a good idea.

### 1058 Preventing Binge Drinking

Danielle: They’re at it again. Those college kids next door are having another kegger.

Nabil: That’s what we get for buying a house this close to a college. College students will have keggers and they’ll binge drink. It’s a rite of passage.

Danielle: It’s dangerous to their health and a menace to the neighborhood, and I’m going to do something about it.

Nabil: There’s nothing we can do. If it gets out of hand, we can call the cops, but let’s not overreact.

Danielle: I’m not overreacting. They’re college students, so I’m going to teach them about the dangers of binge drinking.

Nabil: What are you going to do?

Danielle: I’m going to wait on the sidewalk and pass out flyers as people arrive. This flyer lists the many health reasons they should moderate their drinking. It’s for their own good.

Nabil: And you think college students are going to give you the time of day?

Danielle: I won’t let them pass unless they agree to drink responsibly.

Nabil: I have a feeling we’ll see the cops tonight.

Danielle: You think the party will get out of hand?

Nabil: No, I think they’ll be here to arrest the crazy lady waylaying people outside of their house!

### 1059 Feeling Restless and Jumpy

Adam: Sit still and stop bouncing your leg like that!

Ellen: Sorry, I didn’t realize I was doing it. I’m just a little jittery.

Adam: Well, try to chill out. We’re supposed to be studying, and your restlessness is distracting.

Ellen: I can’t help it. I’m like this because I had a lot of coffee. That’s the only way I can do an all-nighter.

Adam: But how can you study when you’re fidgeting all the time? Stop tapping your pen on the table!

Ellen: Sorry. It’s either I’m worked up or I fall asleep, and tomorrow’s test is a make-or-break one for me. I’ve got to do well.

Adam: I don’t see how you can get any studying done when you’re strung out on caffeine. You’re so jumpy, and I think you’re starting to twitch. Why don’t you try to counteract the caffeine by drinking lots of water?

Ellen: Do you know how long it took me to get this keyed up? I’m not doing anything to reduce the effects.

Adam: Fine.

Ellen: Hey, where are you going?

Adam: Anywhere but here!

### 1060 Disposing of Sensitive Documents

Marcus: All right, let’s get started. These documents won’t sort themselves.

Rebecca: I really don’t think sorting through documents is the best use of my time. Can’t the company find an intern to do this?

Marcus: We have confidential information in these files, and unless we want a security breach, only people who are authorized to see it are allowed to do this job.

Rebecca: Lucky us.

Marcus: Okay, we need to purge these files of outdated material. Let’s start by sorting them into two piles for either retention or destruction.

Rebecca: And then what?

Marcus: Then we have to further sort the destruction pile, either for disposal in the recycling bin or to be shredded.

Rebecca: And who are the lucky people who get to do the shredding?

Marcus: We get that honor, too.

Rebecca: You’re kidding! I’m all for safeguarding confidential information, but couldn’t we just burn it all in a giant bonfire?

Marcus: And who do you think would be responsible for doing that, and for extinguishing the wildfire we start?

### 1061 Shopping for Men’s Shoes

Curran: I like these tennis shoes. I need a new pair.

Beth: We’re here to buy you some dress shoes for attending Chelsey’s wedding. You can’t go wearing those worn-out loafers, and you need time to break them in.

Curran: All right. Just pick whatever you think is suitable and let’s go.

Beth: Don’t you want to have a say in what you wear? I think these oxfords are nice. What do you think?

Curran: Great. I’m a size 10 and a half. I’ll try them on and we’ll go.

Beth: You can’t just buy the first pair of shoes you see. How about these?

Curran: Those patent leather shoes? They have purple laces. Well, if you think they’re okay . . .

Beth: No, they’re not. These shoes are totally wrong for the occasion, not to mention hideous. I was just trying to get a rise out of you so you’ll pick the shoes you like.

Curran: But I don’t care what I wear. Just pick a pair.

Beth: No, you pick.

Curran: Fine. How about these?

Beth: No, they’re not dressy enough. They look more like sandals than dress shoes.

Curran: Then how about these?

Beth: Those boots? Definitely not.

Curran: Okay, these then.

Beth: Those shoes fasten with Velcro. Are you kidding me?

Curran: Okay, why don’t you just tell me what my taste should be and I’ll buy what you want me to buy?

Beth: And leave you with no say in your own purchase? What kind of cousin would I be if I did that?

### 1062 Being a Bachelor

Iris: I’m thinking of inviting Simone and Jerry over for dinner.

Alex: This isn’t another attempt at matchmaking, is it? Jerry is a confirmed bachelor and he’s not looking to marry or become involved in a relationship.

Iris: He’s not a confirmed bachelor. In this neighborhood, with so many single women, he’s an eligible bachelor.

Alex: You mean in this neighborhood full of old spinsters! Stop trying to set him up with one of them.

Iris: How do you know he doesn’t want a relationship? Maybe he’s just shy and needs a little prodding. Maybe he has a fear of commitment and we can all help him overcome it.

Alex: Maybe he just wants to be left alone by meddling neighbors and ladies on the prowl. There are many benefits to remaining a bachelor.

Iris: You mean living a celibate and empty life?

Alex: You’re making too many assumptions. You don’t know the first thing about his life and whether he’s happy or not. In many ways, a bachelor’s life is idyllic.

Iris: How can you say that?

Alex: Would any bachelor have to have this conversation with anyone, ever?

### 1063 Preparing for a New Baby

Wanda: Oh hi, I wasn’t expecting you today.

Enrique: We’ve been cleaning out our garage, and your sister said I should come by with a few things for your baby.

Wanda: That’s really sweet of you guys, but I’m not due for another six months.

Enrique: But you’ll need these things to get the baby’s room ready, right?

Wanda: Well, we don’t actually have a baby room set up yet.

Enrique: There’s no time like the present. Here’s a crib and the mattress. It just needs to be assembled. Oh, here are some bumper pads that go with it.

Wanda: Great.

Enrique: Here’s a changing table.

Wanda: Wow, that’s really big.

Enrique: Here are two car seats, one for infants and one for toddlers, and here’s a booster seat.

Wanda: That’s a lot of stuff. Are you sure you want to part with all this?

Enrique: Positive. Here’s a basic baby monitor and a video monitor so you can keep tabs on the little one.

Wanda: Whoa, what’s in all these bags?

Enrique: They’re baby and kids clothes. You’ll need more than you think.

Wanda: That’s really generous of both of you, but are you sure you want to give it all to me?

Enrique: Of course, you’re family and this will help you save a lot of money.

Wanda: And it’ll free up garage space for your new workshop?

Enrique: Well, why not kill two birds with one stone?

### 1064 Spotting Trends

Heidi: You look very relaxed reading magazines in the middle of the workday.

Tim: It’s my job. I’m tasked with spotting new trends.

Heidi: And you do that by reading magazines with your feet up?

Tim: Why not? I also frequent places where hipsters hang out, listening to their conversations and observing what they’re wearing, eating, drinking, and doing.

Heidi: That doesn’t sound too onerous.

Tim: It’s all about finding the trendsetters, the people who are beta testers and early adopters. These are also the bellwethers for when a trend has run its course.

Heidi: Can’t you just see what people are buying?

Tim: By then, it’s too late. Those are people who are jumping on the bandwagon, not the movers and shakers.

Heidi: Well, don’t look at me. I lag behind every trend and don’t have any idea what’s in or out.

Tim: Luckily, you have me to tell you. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about your choice of footwear . . .

### 1065 Making Soups and Stews

Charlotte: Mmm, something smells good.

Mohamed: Hey, put down that lid!

Charlotte: Sorry, I just wanted to see what you’re making.

Mohamed: I’m making chicken soup.

Charlotte: I’m really in the mood for a hearty stew. There’s nothing more appetizing on a cold day than a good stew.

Mohamed: Right, well, this is a simple chicken soup with a clear stock and vegetables.

Charlotte: All you would have to do is thicken the soup and let it simmer a little longer. Then, presto! You have a stew.

Mohamed: I get it. You’re partial to thick soups, but I feel like making a simple chicken soup. I don’t have time to cook a stew in a slow cooker, which is how I usually make it, not in a pot.

Charlotte: All right, all right. Oh, a nice purée or bisque would be nice too. Doesn’t a chowder sound good right now? I could really go for a nice bowl of chowder.

Mohamed: Fine, we’ll have chowder for dinner tomorrow.

Charlotte: Really?

Mohamed: Yes, and it’ll be the best chowder you’ve ever tasted – that comes out of a can.

### 1066 Buying a Luxury Car

Narin: This car is amazing.

Daniel: I know. It has every luxury option available.

Narin: This sumptuous interior is so comfortable.

Daniel: You haven’t seen anything yet. It has a climate control system for every seat and a voice-activated entertainment system. It also has the best navigation system money can buy. Let me turn this car on with the remote starter.

Narin: That’s impressive. How does it drive?

Daniel: It drives like a dream. It has the most responsive handling of any car I’ve driven, and it has such a smooth ride you’d hardly know we’re moving.

Narin: You’re right. It’s like riding on a cloud.

Daniel: And this car is safe, too. It has seven air bags and an alert system for blind spots, which helps to avoid front and rear collisions.

Narin: Can you give me a ride home?

Daniel: No, I have to get this car back to the car lot before my boss notices it’s gone.

Narin: Couldn’t you just tell him you were taking a potential customer out on a test drive?

Daniel: Again?

### 1067 Major Dental Work

Sadie: Hi, I’m Sadie. You must be Gordon.

Gordon: Yes, I am. It’s nice to meet you. It’s a little strange to be set up, isn’t it?

Sadie: It was nice of Felina and Jaime to arrange this date.

Gordon: It was. Jaime told me that you’re a dentist. Is that right?

Sadie: Yes.

Gordon: That must be interesting work.

Sadie: Well, I think so. Just today, I did a root canal and removed a set of wisdom teeth. Oh, but you wouldn’t want to hear about that.

Gordon: Sure, I do. I want to get to know you better.

Sadie: In that case, since I live in a small town, I do basic dental work, but also act as a periodontist, oral surgeon, and orthodontist when the need arises.

Gordon: Wow, that’s a lot of dental knowledge to keep up on.

Sadie: I don’t mind. One day, it’s cavities and crowns, and the next, extractions, bridgework, dentures, implants, and inlays. I had a very interesting case the other day…

Gordon: Go on.

Sadie: It’s a little unpleasant, maybe not good dinner conversation.

Gordon: Maybe you’re right. It’s not always a good idea to talk shop over dinner.

Sadie: Felina didn’t mention what you did for a living.

Gordon: I’m a proctologist.

Sadie: Ah, I see your point.

### 1068 An Expiring Business Lease

Jane: Our lease is up at the end of this year and we need to negotiate a new one.

Monty: I know, but if I bring it up first, the landlord will think I’m desperate to renew.

Jane: We are desperate to renew. We’ve built our business here, and it would be really difficult to uproot it and reestablish it elsewhere.

Monty: I know, but given our antagonistic dealings in the past, I’m afraid the landlord is going to jack up our rent and we’ll be forced out.

Jane: It’s in the best interest of the landlord to keep a steady business leasing his property.

Monty: He might not see it that way. He might see this as an opportunity to bring in a higher-paying tenant.

Jane: Or he may realize that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

Monty: Or he might think, “Out with the old and in with the new.”

Jane: You won’t know until you contact him.

Monty: Right, but I think I’ll let him stew just a little longer.

### 1069 Disinheriting a Child

Vince: That’s it! I’ve had it with Daniel defying me at every turn. I want him to follow in my footsteps and study law, but he wants to be an artist. He dates girls I don’t approve of. But this! This is beyond the bounds of what I’ll tolerate.

Alana: I know you’re upset, but don’t do anything rash. I’m sure Daniel didn’t mean what he said.

Vince: Oh, he meant it. That’s it! I’m disowning and disinheriting him.

Alana: I’m sure you don’t mean that. You both spoke in anger. I’m sure a cooling-off period of a few days will change his mind.

Vince: It’ll be too late. I’m cutting him out of my will tomorrow. I have other descendants who’ll appreciate inheriting my money and property.

Alana: But Daniel is your rightful heir. He’s your only child.

Vince: Then he should have known how his hateful words would hurt me.

Alana: What did he say exactly?

Vince: He said he has become a San Francisco Giants fan. A Giants fan!

Alana: That’s it?

Vince: That’s it?! He’s wounded me to the core!

### 1070 Getting a Mortgage Loan

Kiko: Figuring out how to fill out this mortgage loan application is like trying to read a foreign language. I don’t know what all these terms mean.

Rafael: Let’s see if we can figure it out together. I think we want a fixed-rate mortgage, not an adjustable-rate mortgage. We want to lock in a good annual percentage rate and not worry about the rate going up.

Kiko: All right, I think that’s what we want. We want the principal and interest payments to be predictable.

Rafael: That’s right.

Kiko: And what are points?

Rafael: I think that has to do with fees for getting the loan.

Kiko: It looks like we have to get an appraisal of the house we want to buy.

Rafael: Yes, that’s standard, I think.

Kiko: Do we have to pay for private mortgage insurance?

Rafael: Not if we have a down payment of more than 20 percent of the price of the house.

Kiko: Okay, so we don’t need to worry about that expense, but what about all these others?

Rafael: Like what?

Kiko: Like homeowners insurance and title insurance?

Rafael: I’m not sure.

Kiko: And what are balloon payments and prepayment penalties?

Rafael: You got me.

Kiko: And what’s included in the closing costs?

Rafael: I’m really out of my depth here.

Kiko: Me, too. What should we do now?

Rafael: Continue to rent?

### 1071 Waiting for Drug Approval

Florence: A package came for you. I think it’s from overseas.

Alexander: Oh, those are my drugs.

Florence: You’re buying your medication from overseas?

Alexander: I have no choice. This drug isn’t FDA-approved yet.

Florence: Isn’t it dangerous to take a drug that isn’t approved?

Alexander: Not if it’s been approved in other countries. This drug is considered experimental here, but has been used in other countries safely for years.

Florence: But shouldn’t you just wait? How long could the process take anyway?

Alexander: You have no idea. It can take years for a drug to be approved here, especially those that aren’t fast-tracked.

Florence: That’s hard to believe.

Alexander: It’s true. First, it has to be tested on animals or in a lab, and then it has to go through clinical trials. Only then is it put through a rigorous review by the FDA, which alone can take years.

Florence: You’re right. I had no idea.

Alexander: In the meantime, I’m suffering needlessly.

Florence: You can’t legally import the drug for your own use, right?

Alexander: That’s right, but I feel like I have to circumvent the law to get the medicine I need.

Florence: So how does it feel to be an outlaw?

Alexander: Um, healthy?

### 1072 Working Part-Time Jobs

Luisa: Are you still here? I thought you got off at three o’clock.

Max: I picked up a second shift. I could use the money.

Luisa: But I thought you had another part-time job in the evenings.

Max: I normally do, but the restaurant where I work has been cutting back my hours, so I’m trying to pick up as many extra shifts here as I can.

Luisa: And don’t you work at the amusement park on the weekend?

Max: I do half the year, but it’s winter and the park only keeps a skeleton crew on during these months. In the meantime, I’m working for a temp agency, which gives me short-term assignments.

Luisa: I don’t know how you juggle all these jobs.

Max: I have no choice. I have to piece together an income if I want to pay rent.

Luisa: Have you ever thought about going back to school to qualify for other work, something full-time?

Max: Sure, all the time. I’d like a better job, one with benefits and a reliable salary.

Luisa: What’s stopping you?

Max: I have to pay for something called “food,” and I haven’t met my fairy godmother yet!

### 1073 Seeking Asylum

Julie: The government is out to get me. I feel like I don’t have any real freedom and everything I do is being monitored.

Ed: Maybe you should move to another country.

Julie: I guess that’s one solution.

Ed: Yes, you should seek asylum in another country.

Julie: Become a refugee? I’m not sure I want to do that.

Ed: Well, if you feel like you’re being persecuted, you should look for other options.

Julie: That seems a little extreme.

Ed: People who are being treated unfairly because of their political opinions or religious beliefs have the option to emigrate.

Julie: I’m not sure I’d go that far.

Ed: I urge you to think about it. Other countries have resettlement programs for refugees, and not every country will have reached their quota yet this year. You might still find a country that will take you.

Julie: I didn’t say that I wanted to renounce my citizenship. I was just letting off steam.

Ed: That’s the problem with you young people these days. You have no follow-through and no courage of your convictions. You all need to man up!

### 1074 Becoming a Vegetarian/Vegan

Ashley: I’m thinking of becoming a vegetarian. I think it would be the ethical thing to do.

Paul: Are you going to eat eggs and dairy? If you’re doing this for ethical reasons, you really should avoid anything made with animal products or animal by-products.

Ashley: I guess you’re right.

Paul: Then you’re going to be a vegan. You won’t be able to eat any milk, butter, cheese, or yogurt.

Ashley: Really? I guess I’ll have to be a vegan then.

Paul: You’ll have to eat a varied diet so you don’t have a vitamin deficiency.

Ashley: Yes, I’ll have to guard against that.

Paul: Are you going to avoid buying things that are animal-derived, too? Like leather shoes and belts?

Ashley: I hadn’t thought of that. I suppose I should.

Paul: Are you having second thoughts?

Ashley: No, I just didn’t know there would be so many restrictions.

Paul: Just be glad you didn’t choose to become a fruitarian.

Ashley: What’s that?

Paul: You don’t want to know.

### 1075 Defying Orders

Carol: Hey, where are you going?

Miguel: We can’t sit here doing nothing.

Carol: We have orders to stay here and to keep watch. You know as well as I do what the consequences are of defying orders.

Miguel: I don’t care what kind of punishment I get. I can’t sit still and let things happen without an attempt at intervention.

Carol: What are you going to do, enter the fray without a plan?

Miguel: I have a plan. I’m going to stop what’s going on using whatever means necessary.

Carol: By doing what? Have you thought this through?

Miguel: I’ll get the lay of the land and then formulate some options. Everything will work out.

Carol: And I suppose you expect me to go with you, to stick my neck out, too?

Miguel: That’s up to you. I’m not twisting your arm.

Carol: How do you know that if I stay here, I won’t squeal on you?

Miguel: I don’t. I guess I just have to rely on your sense of honor.

Carol: Oh, come on, let’s go.

Miguel: You’re coming with me?

Carol: Against my better judgment!

### 1076 Celebrity Product Lines

Nick: The possibilities are endless! You have to take advantage of being at the height of your career.

Jessica: I don’t know about lending my name to a celebrity product line. Wouldn’t people think I was selling out?

Nick: Of course not. Most celebrities do it nowadays. People expect you to leverage your fame into a successful business.

Jessica: But licensing my name to a lot of products that I would then have to promote isn’t exactly how I want to spend my time.

Nick: But think of the upside. You would be building a brand with longevity, hedging your bets for the future.

Jessica: You mean in the future when I’m no longer as famous or as popular.

Nick: No, of course that’s not what I mean. You’ll be a star forever. But don’t you want to get a piece of the pie while the getting is good?

Jessica: I don’t know. What kind of merchandise are we talking about?

Nick: We can start with a clothing line and then branch out into household products, luggage, and even weight-loss products.

Jessica: Weight-loss products?! What are you implying?

Nick: Nothing! I didn’t mean weight-loss products. I meant food – glamorous, beautiful food. See what I mean? The sky’s the limit!

### 1077 Buying Travel Insurance

Josette: I admit it. I’m a nervous traveler and I don’t like traveling internationally.

Tae-jin: You could get travel insurance. Doing that would make you feel more secure, wouldn’t it?

Josette: Maybe. What types of coverage are available?

Tae-jin: You could get insurance to cover mishaps on the trip, such as cancelled flights or missed connections and having your luggage lost, stolen, or damaged. It’ll even cover your losses if your trip is cancelled.

Josette: I guess that would help, but I’m more nervous about something happening to me while I’m in another country.

Tae-jin: In that case, you can get medical insurance to cover the costs of medical emergencies, even if you have to be medically evacuated in the event of serious injuries or illness.

Josette: Oh, you’re right. I could get really sick or injured.

Tae-jin: And if things go terribly wrong, there’s even insurance for if you become disabled or if there’s an accidental death. They’ll pay for repatriation of your remains or overseas funeral services.

Josette: Disabilities and death? Is that supposed to put my mind at ease?

Tae-jin: The whole point is to make you less worried about bad things happening while you travel.

Josette: Right, and right now the only insurance that seems to be foolproof is staying put!

### 1078 Watching Action Movies

Claude: Oh no, this isn’t another action movie, is it?

Jean: Of course not. I know you like thrillers, and this is a thriller.

Claude: This definitely seems like a brainless action movie to me. That’s the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film.

Jean: It’s a thriller that’s supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat. Of course it’ll have some fight scenes.

Claude: And car chases? We’ve had three of those already, too.

Jean: Like any good thriller, it has a hero in a life-threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pursuit.

Claude: That sounds like a run-of-the-mill action movie to me. This movie is full of visual effects and stunts. It’s all about the adrenaline rush. It’s not what I would call a psychological thriller.

Jean: Maybe it straddles the line between an action film and a thriller, but it’s good, isn’t it?

Claude: I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent fight scene is over.

### 1079 Receiving Letters and Packages in the Mail

Celeste: Did the mail come?

Anwar: Yes, you got some letters and a package.

Celeste: Oh, I hope that one of those envelopes has the photos Naomi promised us. Did you notice the postmark?

Anwar: No, but they’re sitting in the hall.

Celeste: Those photos are overdue and should have been delivered days ago. Naomi thought she might not have put enough postage on the envelope, but I thought it must have been misdelivered.

Anwar: You can look at it yourself. The package you received was sent using overnight delivery.

Celeste: I wonder who sent it and why they sent it using expedited service.

Anwar: I don’t know. Why don’t you go look?

Celeste: I wonder if there’s anything perishable in it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.

Anwar: I have no idea. There’s also a letter that’s been forwarded from our old address that has delivery confirmation.

Celeste: Oh, I wonder what that could be.

Anwar: You know what?

Celeste: What?

Anwar: All of those mysteries can be solved if you just go and open your mail.

Celeste: I know, but isn’t it more fun to speculate?

### 1080 Automating Production

Lauren: Wow, that was an impressive demonstration of how robots can be used in production. I think that we need robots like those to automate some of the functions in our factories.

Yves: I admit the demonstration was eye-opening, but I don’t think the technology is there yet to allow us to replace people with robots.

Lauren: No, not for many of the functions, but we could have them do some of the more routine and hazardous tasks.

Yves: You mean have them work alongside our current workers? I’m not sure how our workers would take it. Wouldn’t the robots get in the way?

Lauren: Not with their sophisticated sensors, which allow them to avoid other people or machines.

Yves: I don’t know. Introducing automation would be tricky.

Lauren: What’s important is that they’ll increase production and reduce accidents. The demonstration showed how easy it is to program one of those robots, even when fine calibration is required.

Yves: I’m thinking of the people in the factories. Wouldn’t we have a riot on our hands if we tried to replace people with robots?

Lauren: It’s the wave of the future.

Yves: So you wouldn’t object to a robot replacing you?

Lauren: Me? They’ll never replace me with a robot. I’m indispensable.

Yves: Just like the typewriter?

### 1081 Personal Grooming

Giorgio: I’ll pick you up tonight at 7:00, okay?

Anna: You’d better make it 8:00. I need time to get ready.

Giorgio: You just need to go home, take a shower, and throw on some clothes. How much time do you need?

Anna: You have no idea what a woman has to do to look her best, do you? Not only do I have to bathe, I need to exfoliate and depilate.

Giorgio: “Depilate”?! What’s that?

Anna: That’s shaving and waxing to you. I have to shave and wax my legs, my armpits, and bikini area.

Giorgio: Whoa! That’s way too much information. I didn’t need to know that.

Anna: After that, I’ll need my nail clippers, nail file, and tweezers to do my nails and my plucking.

Giorgio: I don’t even want to know what you pluck.

Anna: Just my eyebrows and my . . .

Giorgio: Stop! I don’t need to know the ins and outs of your personal grooming. Is all that really necessary?

Anna: You are going to introduce me to your brother, aren’t you? Your very handsome brother?

Giorgio: I was until I heard all that. I don’t know if I want my brother dating a woman who’s so high-maintenance.

Anna: High-maintenance? High-maintenance?! Who are you calling high-maintenance?

Giorgio: And high-strung!

### 1082 Traveling to a Remote Island

Leandro: When you said you got a plum job working abroad, I thought you were going to Europe or Asia. Where exactly is Hueller Island?

Alysson: It’s in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Here, I’ll show you on the map.

Leandro: Wow, I had no idea you’d be working in such a far-flung place. It’s a bit remote, isn’t it?

Alysson: It is, but it’s also unspoiled and beautiful. I’ve seen photos and it looks like my idea of paradise. See? After I get settled, you should come for a visit.

Leandro: It looks a little desolate. Is it hard to get to?

Alysson: You would need to take a 19-hour flight from here to the mainland and then a two-day boat ride to reach it.

Leandro: Aren’t you worried about living in such isolation? It’s so far from civilization.

Alysson: There are other people living on the island, you know, so it’s not like I wouldn’t see another living soul for days.

Leandro: Oh, I’m glad there’s a community living there. What is the population of Hueller Island?

Alysson: It’s small, which isn’t unusual for an island this size.

Leandro: How small?

Alysson: When I move there, it’ll increase to seven. And if you visit, you’ll make eight.

Leandro: I’ll give the idea of that trip all the consideration it deserves.

### 1083 Types of Pants

Josh: We are going to get you out of those baggy sweatpants and into some pants that fit.

Kayla: I don’t like pants that are too formfitting.

Josh: I’m not suggesting you buy skintight leggings, but some nice slacks would be slimming.

Kayla: I like pants with an elastic waistband. They’re more comfortable.

Josh: Just try these khaki chinos. They’re not too tight, they’re made of a breathable fabric, and they’re comfortable.

Kayla: I’d rather buy a pair of broken-in jeans.

Josh: You can’t wear jeans to your new job.

Kayla: I know, but these pants are too constricting. Do you think they sell dressy sweatpants?

Josh: That is the best example of an oxymoron I’ve ever heard.

### 1084 Learning a New Operating System

Vanessa: [gasps] What happened to my computer overnight? This can’t be my computer.

Reza: It is. The tech guys installed a new operating system on all of the computers after hours.

Vanessa: But my desktop looks completely different. Where is the menu bar? I don’t know how to open any of my applications.

Reza: You’ll have to get used to a completely different user interface. It’s been completely revamped.

Vanessa: But I had the old operating system customized with special settings.

Reza: Well, those settings are gone. You’ll have to start over.

Vanessa: I don’t even know where to begin.

Reza: With this new operating system, you’re supposed to navigate around using those icons. They’re supposed to make multitasking easier by allowing you to minimize and maximize applications more quickly.

Vanessa: How can that be when I don’t know what any of the icons represent?

Reza: Search me. Here’s one of the tech guys now. You can ask him all your questions.

Vanessa: I only have one.

Reza: Only one?

Vanessa: Yes. Can he restore my old operating system?

### 1085 Having Good and Bad Luck

Cesar: I can’t catch a break. Everything seems to be going wrong these days.

Olga: Maybe your streak of bad luck is because you did something unlucky.

Cesar: What do you mean?

Olga: Have you walked under a ladder or crossed paths with a black cat lately?

Cesar: I don’t think so, but I’m not superstitious. I don’t believe breaking a mirror will bring me seven years of bad luck.

Olga: Say what you will, but it doesn’t hurt to take some precautions, especially the way things have been going for you.

Cesar: I don’t know . . .

Olga: Here, you can borrow my rabbit’s foot and my four-leaf clover. I’ll go home to get you a horseshoe so you can hang it upside down over your front door.

Cesar: I really doubt any of that is going to do me any good.

Olga: You know what tomorrow is, don’t you?

Cesar: The thirteenth?

Olga: Friday the thirteenth. Do you really want to take your chances?

Cesar: I guess not. Do you really think these good luck charms will help?

Olga: We’ll know on the fourteenth, won’t we?

### 1086 Giving Bribes to Children for Good Behavior

Camille: No, you can’t have a new bike if you get an A on the test. You should study because you want to do well in school. We’ll talk about it when I get home tonight. Kids!

Aaron: What’s the matter?

Camille: My kids won’t do anything without an incentive. I know it’s my own fault for offering rewards for good behavior, but now all they want to know is what they’ll get to do what I ask.

Aaron: Rewards are okay if you use them sparingly, aren’t they?

Camille: That’s the problem. I feel like I have to bribe them to do the simplest things. I get home from work and I’m tired and frazzled. I don’t want another power struggle, so I rely on bribes. It’s backfired.

Aaron: How do you mean?

Camille: Now my kids won’t do anything without knowing what’s in it for them. And they keep upping the ante. Soon I’ll have to start forking over cash to get them to behave.

Aaron: I don’t know what to say. When I was growing up, my mother put the fear of God into us. We wouldn’t dare misbehave for fear of making her angry. We never got rewards for good behavior. It was just expected of us.

Camille: What’s your mother’s number? Is she available to babysit?

Aaron: Uh, I don’t know. I don’t think she could inspire that kind of obedience from other people’s children.

Camille: I’m desperate! At the very least, she can give me a few parenting lessons.

### 1087 Selecting Window Treatments

[doorbell rings]

Otto: Hi, I’m Otto from Windows-R-Us. I’m here to show you the window treatment options we offer and to take measurements for installation if you decide to order from our store.

Jean: Hi, Otto. I’m Jean. Come on in. I want to get some new window treatments for the living room. Can you show me what you have?

Otto: Sure. For the living room, I would recommend these beautiful wooden shutters. Opening the slats allows light to filter in and closing them blocks light and gives you privacy.

Jean: They’re nice, but I think they may be a little too expensive for me.

Otto: In that case, you might like blinds, mini blinds, or vertical blinds. They have the same function as shutters at a fraction of the price.

Jean: Those are still a little bit pricey. Are there any other options?

Otto: Well, you could go with curtains. You can choose the type of curtain rods that match your décor and any kind of fabric. With a valance, they would look very nice.

Jean: Nice fabric could cost a lot of money. Any other suggestions?

Otto: Do you have a bedsheet?

Jean: Yes.

Otto: Nail it over your window and call it a day. Have a nice day, ma’am.

[door slams]

### 1088 Selling a Business

Andy: I can’t believe you’re really selling up. I thought you’d stick it out for another year.

Robin: Business has been slow for three years running and I can’t count on things to pick up anytime soon. I’m selling this business now before it’s completely worthless.

Andy: You should get a good price with all that equipment and inventory.

Robin: I’m hoping that my valuation is in line with what buyers want to pay. I plan to sweeten the pot by offering my consulting services as part of the deal. I’ll introduce the new owners to my suppliers and clients, go over the books with them, and help them set up daily operations.

Andy: That should give them a jump-start. With all that knowledge, you could start a new business on the other side of town and hope that business is better there.

Robin: I couldn’t do that. The sales contract has a non-compete clause. That’s only fair.

Andy: I guess. What are you going to do now?

Robin: I’m not sure yet. With the proceeds of the sale, I might try my hand at something entirely different.

Andy: How different?

Robin: I’ve always wanted to own an ice cream shop.

Andy: An ice cream shop in Alaska? You might want to rethink that business plan.

### 1089 Unconventional Marriages

Karam: You and Daniel have been dating for over a year. Are you guys thinking of tying the knot?

Raphaela: I’m not sure. Neither Daniel nor I believe in following conventions. We’re both open to an unconventional relationship.

Karam: What kind of unconventional relationship?

Raphaela: Many different kinds. We’re very open-minded.

Karam: Okay, for instance, would you guys be open to polygamy? Somehow I can’t picture either of you sharing your spouse with someone else.

Raphaela: Well, no, I don’t think that would be right for us. The more people involved in a relationship, the more difficult it becomes, I think.

Karam: Then you wouldn’t be open to an open marriage.

Raphaela: That’s probably not something I’d want.

Karam: The only other unconventional marriages I can think of are arranged marriages and May-December romances. Neither of those applies to you and Daniel. Am I missing something?

Raphaela: Well, we’d be open to living apart. We’re both very independent and would want to retain that independence.

Karam: Ah, then there’s my answer. I know what kind of unconventional marriage you’d have.

Raphaela: What?

Karam: A relationship without cohabitating? Dating.

### 1090 Speaking About the Future

Robert: These designs are really futuristic-looking.

Mara: I’m trying to be forward-thinking and imagine what the world will be like in 50 to 100 years.

Robert: You think that the world will be filled with space-age gadgets like these?

Mara: That’s the natural evolution of technology for the next 100 years, I think. We will continue to develop labor-saving devices, simpler ways of doing everyday tasks, and to improve artificial intelligence.

Robert: I’m not sure I want to live in a world that looks like that. It seems so cold and impersonal.

Mara: That’s only because most of us have a fear of the unknown.

Robert: That’s me in a nutshell. I’d rather return to a simpler way of life with as little innovation and technology as possible.

Mara: Like modern sanitation and transportation?

Robert: Well, I want to go back in time with some things, but keep my conveniences.

Mara: So you want to pick and choose? That shouldn’t be a problem when we figure out time travel.

### 1091 Punishing Children

Yuki: What are you doing?

Al: I’m getting ready to give Charlie a spanking for beating up his classmate. He has to learn that there are serious consequences for his actions.

Yuki: You’re punishing him for beating someone by giving him a beating? That doesn’t make sense. Our response shouldn’t be an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

Al: I’m not going to beat him. This isn’t going to be a flogging. I’m going to give him a simple spanking.

Yuki: Corporal punishment isn’t the answer. We can give him a severe punishment without resorting to violence.

Al: What kind of punishment? Withholding his allowance or taking away his toys? Those don’t seem severe enough to me.

Yuki: We could ground him for a month, only allowing him to go to school.

Al: That still doesn’t seem to be enough.

Yuki: All right, we can pull out the big guns then. We could have him spend the weekend with your mother and ask her to talk some sense into him. He’s scared of your mother.

Al: I’m scared of my mother. Do you think it would work?

Yuki: If I were a 10-year-old and I had to face your angry and disapproving mother for an entire weekend, I’d be quaking in my boots!

### 1092 Keeping a Meeting On Track

Lynda: Could I say one more thing about that?

Bruce: I’m afraid we’re running short on time. Maybe we could wrap up this discussion now.

Lynda: Before we leave this topic, though, I really think we should talk about next year’s plans.

Bruce: That’s outside the scope of this meeting. We can put it on the agenda for next time.

Lynda: But we won’t meet again for a month. We should spend some time talking about our plans for next year. I think we should consider closing the Irvine office and moving it to Franklin. It would save us a lot of money.

Bruce: If we get off on a tangent, we won’t be able to get through our discussion for today. Let’s try to get back on track and discuss the main focus of today’s meeting, which is how to end this year without any more problems. I feel like we’re getting close to making some decisions.

Lynda: We can’t make any decisions when there are still so many unresolved issues. Things are still up in the air because we don’t know what will happen next year. Any decisions we make now will be moot if our assumptions are wrong.

Bruce: I’m afraid we differ on that. I think we have enough information now to forge ahead. We can come to some tentative decisions and make any adjustments later. Should we take it to a vote?

Lynda: If you insist. I still think it’s premature.

Bruce: I’ll take that as a “no” vote.

### 1093 Having a Picnic

Bill: Surprise! I brought you here to this beautiful spot for a romantic picnic. I have a very special question to ask you.

Madison: Oh, that’s so sweet. Did you remember to bring a picnic blanket?

Bill: I did. I have everything we’ll need in this picnic basket.

Madison: Don’t put it down there. There are ants. You should put it on the blanket.

Bill: Yes, you’re right.

Madison: And I hope you remembered to bring something to drink. I’m thirsty.

Bill: I brought both food and a bottle of champagne.

Madison: Well, I hope the food isn’t too cold and the champagne isn’t too warm. You know how I hate warm champagne.

Bill: Actually, the food is cold, because I brought chicken sandwiches and potato salad.

Madison: Oh, I thought you would have brought something a little more, well, gourmet or lavish, something a little special.

Bill: That’s why I brought the champagne. It’ll make this picnic extra special.

Madison: I guess we’ll have to make do with warm champagne and sandwiches. I hope you remembered to bring a corkscrew and some dishes and silverware.

Bill: I bought paper plates and plastic utensils.

Madison: Paper and plastic? I guess we’ll have to make do with those, too. Okay, now, you said you had a special question you wanted to ask me. What is it?

Bill: Question? Oh, never mind. It’ll keep.

### 1094 Tracing One’s Genealogy

Aaron: Do you think you can help me trace my genealogy?

Corrie: Sure, I can try. We can get started by talking to your parents and grandparents. Oral interviews will give us some names of your relatives.

Aaron: I’ve already talked to them and I grew up hearing stories about my lineage on both sides of my family.

Corrie: That’s great. If you know of some of the people you’re descended from, we can start by looking at public records and historical records from the area. You’re from Tennessee, right?

Aaron: That’s right. There are a lot of people in Tennessee with my last name, though.

Corrie: Well, we can triangulate the information we get to zero in on your ancestors.

Aaron: What if I want proof positive that I’m related to someone?

Corrie: Then you can have a genetic analysis done. A DNA test is generally accepted proof.

Aaron: Good, it’s about time someone in my family established the blood connections.

Corrie: Blood connections to whom?

Aaron: Elvis, of course.

Corrie: Elvis?! You think you’re related to Elvis?

Aaron: His last name was Presley; my last name is Presley. My first name is Aaron; his middle name was Aaron. It can’t be a coincidence, especially considering my talent.

Corrie: Talent?

Aaron: Sure, listen: “Well, it’s one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, now go, cat, go!”

Corrie: I consider that counterevidence!

### 1095 Childhood Fitness

Mom: Hold it right there. Put that candy bar down.

Justin: Mom, I just wanted a snack to tide me over.

Mom: Don’t you remember what Dad said about this family’s need to improve our level of fitness?

Justin: Only old people have to worry about getting fat.

Mom: It’s not just about getting fat.

Justin: But I’m just a kid. I’m in great shape.

Mom: Childhood obesity is a huge problem in this country. Even if you’re not overweight, people your age lead sedentary lives.

Justin: Whatever that means.

Mom: It means that you sit around all day as couch potatoes watching TV and playing video games. In my day, kids went outside to ride their bikes, climb trees, and run around.

Justin: I don’t have that kind of energy.

Mom: Precisely! You and your brothers are lethargic because you don’t get enough exercise.

Justin: But exercise is tiring.

Mom: That’s because you’re not fit. You have no stamina or endurance.

Justin: I don’t need endurance.

Mom: Stop grumbling. It’s Saturday and you boys should be outside getting some fresh air.

Justin: In Los Angeles?

Mom: Are you smart mouthing me, young man? Get outside or you’ll all be helping me clean the house.

Justin: We’re out of here!

### 1096 Improving Online Reviews

Jerrise: Okay, you were right. We need to do something to improve business. Do you think we should take out an ad in the local newspaper?

Russell: We could do that, but I think a better strategy is to improve our online reviews.

Jerrise: Who looks at websites with unsolicited reviews? I’m not convinced that’ll help us.

Russell: Lots of people look at reviews when choosing which business to patronize. Right now, we only have three stars out of five, and that’s hurting us.

Jerrise: It’s hard to believe that adding a star will really improve our business.

Russell: Believe it. And those mediocre reviews we received last week? We should respond to each one and try to make it right.

Jerrise: Those reviews were written by a few disgruntled customers. We’re always going to have a few whiners.

Russell: Yes, but now they’re much more vocal. If they’re not happy with our service or product, we need to compensate them for their bad experience.

Jerrise: That would put us out of business!

Russell: No, that’s an investment in our business reputation.

Jerrise: What you’re saying is that we need to bribe people to write good reviews.

Russell: I wouldn’t put it that way, but we should recognize that crowdsourcing is the wave of the future and we need to move with the times if our business is to survive.

Jerrise: All right. I guess we can try that.

Russell: What are you doing now?

Jerrise: Writing my own review. I’ve always given myself excellent service!

### 1097 Landscaping a Home

Mona: I want a lawn. I’ve always pictured our new house with a lawn.

Kellan: Lawns require a lot of water and upkeep. I think we should use hardscape for most of the lawn and plant only drought-tolerant plants.

Mona: I don’t want my yard to be full of gravel and rocks. I picture a water feature in the middle, with annuals and perennials planted all around it, surrounded by a big, beautiful lawn.

Kellan: We can have some kind of slow-growing ground cover if you want to, but the rest isn’t practical.

Mona: I don’t know what you mean. We can plant a hedge over there and install planters along the walkway.

Kellan: Who will do the pruning and mulching? Who will pull the weeds and mow the lawn? Who will rake the leaves when the seasons change?

Mona: Well, I guess I will, with your help.

Kellan: Don’t count on me. My motto is: No muss, no fuss!

### 1098 Riding in a Limousine

Mandy: Whoo! Whoo!

Theo: Hey, get down from there. You shouldn’t be sticking your head out of the sunroof.

Mandy: I just wanted to get some air. This stretch limo is amazing.

Theo: Well, I thought I’d rent one and take you to the prom in style.

Mandy: This is the height of luxury. You’ve really outdone yourself.

Theo: Thanks, but maybe we should be careful not to spill drinks on the seats.

Mandy: Everybody drinks and parties in the back of a limo. Why else would they have a wet bar?

Theo: Well, we shouldn’t be drinking out of it. We could get into trouble.

Mandy: The chauffeur doesn’t know what we’re doing back here. The partition is up and it’s soundproof.

Theo: But he could hear us on the intercom system. Let’s just relax and enjoy the ride.

Mandy: You can do that, but I’m going to blast the music and have some fun.

Theo: This isn’t a party bus.

Mandy: No, but it could be a party limo! You’re brilliant. Let’s go pick up a few of my friends. We’ll turn this into a great party.

Theo: What about the prom?

Mandy: We’ll get there, but first we’re going to have a pre-party in our own party limo. What a great idea!

Theo: Me and my big mouth.

### 1099 Child Sports Injuries

Angela: Wait! I need to put sunscreen on Davy before he goes to the game.

Juan: It’s not sunny today. He doesn’t need sunscreen.

Angela: And here are four water bottles to make sure he stays hydrated and doesn’t get heatstroke.

Juan: One of the other parents is bringing drinks for the kids. It’s fine. We don’t need that.

Angela: Make sure Davy warms up and cools down before and after the game. I don’t want him to strain or sprain anything.

Juan: The coach makes sure they do that. Are you done?

Angela: And here’s a first-aid kit in case he skins his knee or gets any other scrapes. We don’t want to risk infection.

Juan: The reason we signed up Davy for organized sports is that all of this is taken care of. There’s even a certified athletic trainer at each game, one of the parents.

Angela: But the other kids can be so rough. He comes home with bruises all the time. I can’t stand seeing him hurt.

Juan: Do you want to come to the game? You can see for yourself that everything is fine.

Angela: How can I watch Davy running into danger? I’d want to run onto the field and save him.

Juan: You’re right. It’s better that you stay here. If you did that, your son would never live it down!

### 1100 Making and Receiving a Job Offer

Salima: Hello.

Jake: Hi, this is Jake Nagano at Fixit Corp. How are you today?

Salima: Oh, hi, Jake. I’m fine. How are you?

Jake: Good. The reason I’m calling is that we’d like to offer you the position you interviewed for last week.

Salima: Oh, that’s great. I was really impressed with Fixit.

Jake: I’m glad to hear it. We’re prepared to offer you a starting salary of $55,000. You will get full medical and dental coverage, and vision coverage is optional.

Salima: I see. And vacation time?

Jake: Vacation days, personal leave, and sick leave accrue one day per month in your first year and then increase with your tenure with the company.

Salima: What would be my job title?

Jake: You’d be a junior specialist, and you’d be working under Monique Stansfield, the department manager.

Salima: Is the salary negotiable at all?

Jake: Well, we would consider any counteroffers, but this is a typical compensation package for new hires in these positions.

Salima: I see.

Jake: Why don’t you think about it? I’ll need to hear back from you by Wednesday. Will that work?

Salima: Sure, no problem. Just one more thing: I heard that the company has a box at the stadium . . .

Jake: Let me stop you right there. I hope that’s not a deal-breaker, because it’s taken me . . . I mean . . . it takes years for employees to get invited.

Salima: No, not a deal-breaker at all. I’m just a fan.

Jake: In that case, it would be a pleasure to welcome you aboard.

### 1101 Problems Getting Along With Family

Oscar: So you’re back from your mother’s birthday dinner. How was it?

Priscilla: Same old, same old. It isn’t a family gathering without a major meltdown or blowup.

Oscar: Yikes, what happened?

Priscilla: You know how it is. It starts out with bickering and somebody taking offense at some slight or dig, or bringing up some old grievance.

Oscar: Well, that happens in most families.

Priscilla: Yeah, but in mine, they often turn into screaming matches. We all raise our voices and somebody always storms out.

Oscar: Even at your mother’s birthday dinner?

Priscilla: The occasion doesn’t matter. My mother tries to be the peacemaker, but it doesn’t take much for tempers to flare.

Oscar: That never happens in my family.

Priscilla: What?! Your family doesn’t fight when it gets together?

Oscar: No, we try to sweep things under the rug and put on a brave face.

Priscilla: What happens when you get mad at each other?

Oscar: Nothing.

Priscilla: What do you mean nothing?

Oscar: A lot of our family meals are eaten in stony silence.

Priscilla: Wow, I think I prefer our knock-down, drag-out fights!

### 1102 Discussing Capital Punishment

Simon: What’s all that?

Hilary: It’s a news report about the upcoming execution of Perry Hickock.

Simon: That’s barbaric. We shouldn’t have capital punishment in this day and age.

Hilary: This guy killed an entire family while trying to rob them in their own home. He was convicted of multiple murders and given the death penalty. This is about justice.

Simon: This is about vengeance. He could have been given a life sentence without the possibility of parole. As it is, he has spent 22 years on death row.

Hilary: Oh, I see, you’re one those people who is soft on crime. You think our criminals should be coddled.

Simon: No, I don’t. But aside from my moral objections, executing someone with a lethal injection or the electric chair is inhumane. Many executions are botched each year.

Hilary: So what? These are people convicted of serious crimes. They deserve all the punishment they get.

Simon: I’m going to have to start calling you “Hang ’em high Hilary.”

Hilary: And I’ll have to start calling you “Soft-hearted Simon.”

### 1103 Sports Tryouts

Marcela: All right, you’re ready for these tryouts. You’ve passed your physical. You’ve trained for months. You’re going to make that team.

Kenji: It’s okay. I don’t need a pep talk. I’m just going to do the best I can.

Marcela: Yes, but you want to have your head in the right place. You’re going to dominate the field. You’re going to intimidate the other players.

Kenji: No, I only want to impress the coach. I’m going to play hard and hold nothing back.

Marcela: Yes, that’s fine, but you want to send a message to the other players that you’re a force to be reckoned with.

Kenji: I’m going to have faith in my abilities and hope for the best.

Marcela: At least try to look tough. Try scowling at the other players like you can’t wait to get them on the field so you can crush them.

Kenji: [sigh] I tell you what, why don’t you scowl for me? I think you’re much scarier than any player who’s ever played this game.

### 1104 Making a Discovery

Pierre: How does it feel to be on the cusp of a new discovery?

Irene: Let’s not jump the gun. We’ve made some major leaps forward, but I’m not sure I’d call what we’ve done so far revolutionary.

Pierre: Not yet, but you’re close to a breakthrough. That’s evident.

Irene: I think you might be overstating the case. If we do make a small breakthrough, it will only contribute to the current body of knowledge in the field, not turn the field on its head.

Pierre: I think you’re downplaying the possible impact of such a discovery. I think you’ll be recognized as a pioneer, a real trailblazer.

Irene: And your contribution?

Pierre: You know what they say: Behind every great woman is a great man!

### 1105 Dressing Appropriately for an Event

Patricia: Hey, look at you! You’re all decked out. What’s the occasion?

Renaud: I’m going to the Ortegas’ party. Aren’t you?

Patricia: Yeah, but I’m not getting all dolled up for it. I think the dress is casual.

Renaud: I heard that it’s going to be an upscale affair, and I don’t want to be underdressed.

Patricia: But I’d rather not be overdressed.

Renaud: Okay, then what are you wearing?

Patricia: I’m going to dress up these jeans with a chic blouse. And then I’m going to accessorize with this necklace as a statement piece.

Renaud: That’s a nice outfit, but it’s more appropriate for a casual event, not a party.

Patricia: But that’s what I’m trying to tell you. This is not a formal affair.

Renaud: Do what you like, but I’m not going to risk being inappropriately dressed for one of the Ortegas’ parties. I don’t want to be blacklisted and not be invited in the future. Their parties are legendary, with the best food, the best booze . . .

Patricia: Oh, you’re right. What was I thinking?!

### 1106 Getting a Flat Tire

Jaloliddin: What is that thumping noise?

Minisa: I don’t hear anything.

Jaloliddin: I think you have a flat tire.

Minisa: The left rear tire has a slow leak, but I just inflated it the last time I was at the gas station, so I’m sure it’s fine.

Jaloliddin: No, really, I think you need to pull off to the side of the road.

Minisa: We’re on a busy freeway, but if you insist.

Jaloliddin: Wow, your tire is definitely flat. See how the tire is completely worn out, with hardly any tread left?

Minisa: Yeah, well, I’ve been meaning to get a new one. Now what?

Jaloliddin: We need to change it. Let’s see if you have a jack and a spare tire.

Minisa: I think they’re in the trunk, but I don’t think I could do it myself.

Jaloliddin: [sigh] Right. I’ll change the tire. Do you have a wrench so I can get the lug nuts off?

Minisa: I have some basic tools in the trunk, too, I think.

Jaloliddin: Put your hazard lights on and I’ll get to work. At least your rim doesn’t look bent.

Minisa: I’m glad to hear that. What should I do?

Jaloliddin: Bone up on basic car maintenance?

### 1107 The Death of a Pet

Dad: Honey, I have some bad news for you. Fluffy has gone to the other side.

Sarah: You mean she’s out of her cage again? I’ll go and try to find her.

Dad: No, you don’t understand. Fluffy passed away in the night.

Sarah: Oh, she died! That’s too bad, but she was getting up there in years.

Dad: Yes, but she didn’t die a natural death. She was run over by the neighbor’s car.

Sarah: You mean she was flattened? Cool!

Dad: Well, I wouldn’t put it that way, but I understand if you’re in shock. I guess people show grief in different ways . . .

Sarah: Fluffy went out with a bang. That’s the way she would have wanted to go.

Dad: I’d like to think of her as being in heaven and she’s gone to meet her maker.

Sarah: I don’t think there’s an afterlife for animals, Dad. It’s all just a part of the circle of life.

Dad: Okay. I thought we could have a funeral for her so we can pay our respects.

Sarah: Is that really necessary?

Dad: I’d thought you’d want one. She was your pet, after all.

Sarah: No, let’s just bury her in the backyard.

Dad: And who said that the youth of today is cynical?

### 1108 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Sydney: Where should we go on our honeymoon? I thought Rome would be nice.

Isaac: Let me check. No, that wouldn’t be a good idea.

Sydney: Okay, how about Tokyo? I’ve always wanted to visit Japan.

Isaac: No, I’m afraid not.

Sydney: How are you making these determinations?

Isaac: I’m checking to see if the U.S. dollar has a favorable exchange rate with those currencies. We want our dollars to go as far as they can.

Sydney: You mean you want to pick our honeymoon destination according to the currency market.

Isaac: I’m just saying that we should take advantage of falling currencies or ones that have already depreciated significantly. A strong dollar means we can get more bang for the buck.

Sydney: So you’re saying that you want us to make plans at the whim of the Federal Reserve and central banks.

Isaac: Well, I wouldn’t go that far. I’m only saying that it would make financial sense.

Sydney: That doesn’t seem like a very romantic way of picking a honeymoon destination.

Isaac: Romance is overrated. Wouldn’t you rather be solvent than sentimental?

Sydney: I’d rather be solvent and sentimental.

### 1109 Reading Poor Handwriting

Lily: Can you make out what this says?

Hassan: Geez, who wrote that?

Lily: My doctor. She wrote down some instructions for me, but I can’t read her handwriting.

Hassan: I have no idea what that chicken scratch says.

Lily: I think that’s a “T,” but maybe it’s an “F.”

Hassan: Face it. Those scribbles are illegible. Why don’t you take a photo of that and email it to her nurse? Maybe she can decipher it for you.

Lily: I feel like if I just keep at it, I’ll be able to work it out.

Hassan: Patients shouldn’t have to try and read a doctor’s sloppy writing. What if they misinterpret it and do the wrong thing as part of their treatment?

Lily: This note isn’t that bad. I think I might have the first two words figured out already.

Hassan: Then you’re better at reading bad penmanship than I am. Maybe you should have a try at these English essays. I have 60 of them to grade.

Lily: Wow, looking at these, I’d say you have 60 future doctors in the making!

### 1110 Experiencing a Drought

Fabian: How long do you think this drought is going to last?

Lia: I have no idea, but I’m not worried. I grew up in the desert. Not having enough precipitation was just a fact of life.

Fabian: Yes, but people here aren’t used to getting this little rainfall. Their livelihood depends on having a reliable water supply for their crops.

Lia: You make it sound like we’re experiencing another Dust Bowl when the water table is just a little low.

Fabian: I think it’s a little more serious than that.

Lia: What we need here is a reservoir. That would give this town the water reserves it needs in case of a drought.

Fabian: What we really need are fewer dust storms and more thunderstorms.

Lia: And for people to stop over farming. That and deforestation are half the problem.

Fabian: You may be right, but that’s not what people want to hear right now. They need some relief.

Lia: Maybe the town’s water conservation efforts will make a difference.

Fabian: Well, I’m certainly willing to stop bathing if it’ll help.

Lia: I thought you already had.

### 1111 Symptoms of Depression

Emily: I think Jackson is depressed.

Shivan: How can you tell?

Emily: Well, he’s been suffering from a loss of appetite and is generally lethargic.

Shivan: Have you noticed any other symptoms?

Emily: He seems to have trouble concentrating and has insomnia.

Shivan: Um, really?

Emily: Yes, and I’m afraid he’s having suicidal thoughts. He seems distant and distracted, staring off into space. He’s not his usual self.

Shivan: How can you tell?

Emily: What do you mean?

Shivan: I mean, he looks the same to me. He just swims back and forth in the fish tank.

Emily: Just look at him. He’s on the edge of mental collapse!

Shivan: Somebody is.

### 1112 Doing Impressions

Edison: [in a high-pitched woman’s voice] “I’m paying you less and working you harder. What are you complaining about?”

Kay: Ha, ha. You sound just like Justine! You really have a gift for doing impressions, but maybe we should shut the door.

Edison: Oh I’m not worried about Justine hearing me. She’s my boss, but she’s not the boss of me.

Kay: What would she say if she saw you imitating the way she walks and the gestures she makes?

Edison: We all know what they say: Imitation is the highest form of flattery. Right?

Kay: I’m not sure Justine would see it that way. It sounds more like mockery to me. I think it’s all in the tone.

Edison: It’s a simple parody of how she normally addresses the staff. It’s all done in good fun. It’s not mean-spirited.

Kay: Of course not, but she might take it the wrong way.

Edison: Then she would need to learn to laugh at herself. It’s healthy for the ego.

Kay: “Whatever you say, boss. You’re always right, boss.”

Edison: Who was that supposed to be?

Kay: Remember what you said about imitation being be the highest form of flattery . . .

Edison: That was supposed to be me? Me?!

### 1113 Having a Family Portrait Taken

Dad: Okay, everybody, take your places.

Mom: We’re in our places. Can’t the photographer just take the photo?

Dad: We have to pose. The whole point is to look natural.

Mom: If you wanted a natural family photo, why are we in a portrait studio in the middle of a sitting?

Dad: I want us to stand in front of a nice background and pose with nice props. I’m tired of looking at the photos that we take. They’re not very good and require hours of touching up or creative cropping.

Mom: Instead, we’re supposed to look natural wearing color-coordinated clothing and standing in unlikely poses.

Dad: Don’t be like that. Generations to come will cherish this family photo.

Mom: I doubt it.

Dad: How about if I ask the photographer to take some shots just of you?

Mom: You mean like the headshots Hollywood stars get?

Dad: Uh, sure, if that’s what you’d want.

Mom: Well, in that case, I’ll need to have my hair cut, get my makeup done, and buy a new outfit . . .

Dad: What have I gotten myself into?!

### 1114 Forms of Government

Margaret: Okay, the teacher said that we should set up an ideal form of government for our imaginary country and then work out detailed plans for governance.

Tony: I think the simplest is a dictatorship. I’ll make all of the decisions.

Margaret: You’re sounding like a fascist. This is supposed to be a partnership, remember?

Tony: Okay then, let’s make it a monarchy. I can be king and you can be queen.

Margaret: You’ll probably still make all of the decisions as king. Maybe we should consider an oligarchy. Your family and mine can rule equally.

Tony: That’s fine with me, but you’re the communist, or at least socialist. Don’t you think an oligarchy would be too elitist? I would think you would prefer a meritocracy of some sort.

Margaret: This isn’t about my personal politics. It’s about what’s best for our imaginary nation. How about a simple democracy?

Tony: There’s nothing simple about a democracy. How about no government at all?

Margaret: You mean anarchy?

Tony: Sure, that would be the simplest.

Margaret: Why do I get the feeling that you’re making suggestions based on the amount of work this assignment will take, rather than political considerations?

Tony: That’s because you’re very perceptive. I have a big weekend planned!

### 1115 Buying Meat from a Butcher

Butcher: Good morning. What can I get for you?

Samantha: I’d like some lamb chops, pork chops, and some beef, but I’m not sure which cuts I want yet.

Butcher: You’ve come to the right butcher shop. Everything here is fresh. Everything comes straight from the slaughterhouse.

Samantha: Um, I’m glad to hear that.

Butcher: In fact, we got in a shipment of game and poultry just this morning. You can buy them bone-in, boneless, or whole. They’re as fresh as if you got them from your own farm or brought them down with your own shotgun.

Samantha: Uh, that’s great. I see that you sell marinated and stuffed meats, too.

Butcher: Yes, we do. We even make our own sausages. We use only the freshest ingredients. They’re so fresh I wouldn’t be surprised if they got up and walked across the floor.

Samantha: Right. I think I’ll just take the chops for now.

Butcher: Are you sure? I can show you some of the best prime cuts of beef you’ll ever see. They’re so fresh you could . . .

Samantha: No, no, that’s all for now. I suddenly feel like a salad for dinner instead.

### 1116 Reading and Processing Emails

Every day I feel more and more overwhelmed by email. Once I turn on my computer and look at my inbox, I get sucked into reading and responding to emails.

I have a personal email account and an email account for work. With my work email, I try to take an organized approach. I scan each email, looking at the sender and subject line, and delete the ones I don’t need or want. With the remaining ones, I archive some, file others for future reading, and write replies to the rest. I’ve set up templates for the routine emails, but spend a lot of time drafting personalized responses to the rest. That takes up a large part of my workday.

When reading my personal email, I take my time. Yes, I get the usual junk that slips through the spam filters and get newsletters I keep meaning to unsubscribe from, but people who have my personal email address are mainly friends and family.

When I’m done and I look at the clock, I’m often surprised at how much time I’ve spent processing email. That’s time I could have been spending working on my Celine Dion impression.

“Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on. . . .”

### 1117 Assembling Furniture

Armand: Did you know that this nightstand required assembly when you bought it?

Suzanne: The box said that it required simple assembly. I guess what’s simple to them isn’t simple to us.

Armand: You can say that again. These instructions aren’t in English, there are no diagrams showing how the parts fit together, and we seem to be missing parts. I also question the quality. It’s mainly made of particleboard and plywood. Do you think we should return it?

Suzanne: No, let’s just keep it and do the best we can.

Armand: That’s hard to do when there seems to be a design flaw with the drawers. The pieces don’t fit together as they should. These nails are also bent and these screws look defective.

Suzanne: It’s not looking good, is it? I also bought this because I thought everything could be assembled using Allen wrenches, but it looks like we’ll actually need a hammer, screwdriver, and maybe a drill.

Armand: Well, let’s see what we can do. If we don’t have the right tools or parts, I have a solution.

Suzanne: What?

Armand: Duct tape.

### 1118 Bidding on Online Auctions

Jermaine: Wait! You shouldn’t bid on that auction right now. Wait until the last minute.

Bethany: This auction has a buy-it-now price of $25 and free shipping.

Jermaine: Don’t pay the buy-it-now price. The minimum bid on this item is $10 and the current bid is only $12.50. There’s no reserve, so if you wait to bid, you may snag it for a much lower price than $25.

Bethany: Okay, I guess I can wait, but why can’t I place a bid of $15 right now?

Jermaine: First of all, the bidding on this auction goes up by increments of 50 cents, so the next bid would be $13. You could place a maximum bid of $15, but someone might outbid you at any time.

Bethany: But couldn’t that happen anyway? Even if I wait until the last minute someone could sneak in and bid a higher price.

Jermaine: You mean they could snipe you? They could, but not if you snipe them back. It’s all in the timing.

Bethany: You seem to know a lot about online auctions.

Jermaine: That item you’re bidding on, guess who listed it?

### 1119 Methods for Quitting Smoking

Lisa: This is it. I’m quitting smoking for good.

Michael: Good for you. Are you going cold turkey?

Lisa: No, I tried that, but it didn’t work. I craved cigarettes too much.

Michael: How about nicotine gum? Have you tried that?

Lisa: Yes, but I didn’t like the side effects. It irritated my throat.

Michael: That’s too bad. I suppose you’ve tried nicotine patches, too?

Lisa: Yes, I have. I became addicted to the patches and couldn’t wean myself off of them. I just traded one addiction for another.

Michael: And electronic cigarettes?

Lisa: They only made me want to smoke a real cigarette. They were no help at all.

Michael: So, what now?

Lisa: I’m going to try hypnosis. I hear that it works for some people.

Michael: And if that doesn’t work?

Lisa: The last resort is acupuncture. Some people say that’s effective for quitting smoking.

Michael: If you say so. Sometimes the cure is truly worse than the disease!

### 1120 Breaching a Contract

Dr. Miao: At Berthiaume College, we take mental health issues very seriously. That’s why we have so many mental health services on campus.

Dean: Such as?

Dr. Miao: Well, for example, there is a meeting tonight of our support group for anorexics and bulimics. Tomorrow night, I’ll be speaking to a group of students about depression to make them aware of the warning signs.

Dean: Those are very important issues.

Dr. Miao: Yes, they are. In this student health center, we see cases ranging from social anxiety disorder to schizophrenia. In addition to serious mental disorders, college students are at risk of developing many types of antisocial behaviors resulting from the pressures of college and the stress of being on their own.

Dean: I know what you mean. One of my roommates copes with stress by binge drinking. My other roommate has become obsessive-compulsive. You should see how clean our apartment is.

Dr. Miao: And you? How have you been dealing with the stress?

Dean: Me? I think I’m the only well-adjusted one in the group.

Dr. Miao: Are you sure? You seem to have developed a nervous habit of pulling your hairs out one at a time.

Dean: What?! No, I haven’t.

Dr. Miao: Denying you have a problem is often a sign that you have a problem.

Dean: That’s crazy!

Dr. Miao: Shh! We don’t use the c-word here. Come with me.

### 1121 Outdoor Sun Protection

June: Wait! You forgot your sun hat.

Wally: I’m not wearing that hat. It looks ridiculous on me.

June: It’ll protect you from the sun’s rays. You’re too fair to be outdoors for long without protection. You don’t want to get another sunburn.

Wally: I’m wearing sunscreen. I’ll be fine.

June: This ChapStick has an SPF of 100. You’ll need that, too.

Wally: All right. Anything else?

June: Yes, these sunglasses will protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays.

Wally: Okay, I’m leaving now. I’m surprised you didn’t get me some protective clothing. My arms and legs are exposed.

June: I’m glad you reminded me. Here’s a sun cape. It’s made of a breathable fabric. Make sure you wear it every minute you’re outside. Promise?

Wally: [sigh]

### 1122 Making Peace

Vladimir: We need a ceasefire. The violence is escalating and we need to put a stop to this.

Hilary: I agree, but do you think our enemies will agree to a truce?

Vladimir: They’re as embattled as we are. They may welcome a suspension of hostilities until we can agree on a peace treaty.

Hilary: I hate to think what their conditions will be for an armistice. This war has dragged on for so long.

Vladimir: I suspect they feel the same as we do. If we make a conciliatory gesture, I think they’ll respond in kind.

Hilary: Do you really think so? We won’t come off as weak?

Vladimir: I don’t think so. We’re taking the first step to peace. They’ll see that.

Hilary: If you say so. All right, let’s do it. This war with our neighbors is getting old. Do you want to bring them this fruitcake or should I?

Vladimir: I’ll take it, but first I’ll make sure their ugly, dirty, mean barking dog that wakes me up in the middle of the night is tied up. I don’t want to become a casualty while bringing them this peace offering!

### 1123 Describing Pleasant Scents

Kitty: Oh, smell that. Isn’t that delectable?

Pepe: Yes, it’s pleasant.

Kitty: Pleasant? It’s heavenly. It has a nice fruity scent, not too sweet.

Pepe: If you say so. I don’t want to buy anything that has a strong perfume smell. I’m a guy.

Kitty: I know, but you want to exude a sexy scent that captivates the opposite sex, right?

Pepe: I’m not sure about that. I just want to smell fresh and clean.

Kitty: All right, how about this one?

Pepe: Uh, it smells musky.

Kitty: Musky is good. Musky is sexy.

Pepe: Not to me. Let’s stick with something basic. I’m buying this one.

Kitty: But that one smells like detergent!

Pepe: Yes, because that’s what I’m buying – detergent for my clothes. I don’t need any fancy scents on my clothes.

Kitty: Have it your way, but you’re missing out on a chance to lure women with your scent.

Pepe: I’ll pass up that chance, thank you very much. If I follow your advice and buy this perfume-smelling detergent, women will definitely get the wrong idea about me!

### 1124 Hiding Money Offshore

Sabrina: Wait! Don’t deposit that money into our regular bank account. I’ll take care of it.

Luis: Okay, but why?

Sabrina: I’ve come up with a way for us to avoid paying so much in taxes each year. I’ve opened an offshore account in the Crook Islands. We can funnel our money into that account and it’ll be untraceable.

Luis: But that’s tax evasion.

Sabrina: The banks in the Crook Islands have ways of covering up the paper trail so no one will be the wiser.

Luis: That doesn’t make it legal.

Sabrina: They haven’t caught us yet.

Luis: You mean you’ve already started putting money into that account?

Sabrina: I’ve been depositing money into it for nearly a year.

Luis: And when were you going to tell me?

Sabrina: I’m telling you now. Trust me. These tax havens are very popular with the rich. We’re just taking a page from their book on how to save money.

Luis: We’re going to get caught. We should come clean now.

Sabrina: That’s why I didn’t tell you before! I knew you’d make a fuss about it.

Luis: And you were right. We need to quietly close the account and bring the money back.

Sabrina: Then we’ll have to pay taxes on it and maybe even a penalty, more than we would’ve had to pay in taxes originally.

Luis: Right, and that’s called poetic justice.

### 1125 Serving Alcoholic Drinks

Bethany: Where is everybody?

Nathan: While you were in the bathroom, the other guys left.

Bethany: In that case, I should go, too. It’s getting late.

Nathan: The night is young. Let me get you a refill.

Bethany: No, I really shouldn’t have another drink. I had a neat drink after dinner and I’m still feeling the effects. I’m a lightweight and I’m not normally a drinker.

Nathan: What’s the harm? Have one for the road. I’ll serve this one straight up and with a twist of lemon. It’s my specialty. I could also mix you a cocktail, if you prefer. Consider it a nightcap.

Bethany: No, I really shouldn’t.

Nathan: All right, I’ll just top off that drink in your hand.

Bethany: No, it’s late, I’m tired, and I have to go.

Nathan: Don’t rush off. You wouldn’t want to get a reputation for being a spoilsport, would you?

Bethany: I prefer that to the alternative!

### 1126 Using a Pawnshop

Jamaica: I need to raise some cash right away. I’m thinking of hocking a few things. You’ve used the pawnshop down the street before, right?

Nolan: Yeah, a few years ago when I lost my job. I needed a short-term loan to tide me over until I could find a new one.

Jamaica: Is the place legit?

Nolan: It seemed to be. I have no complaints.

Jamaica: That’s good. How would I go about pawning something?

Nolan: It’s pretty simple. You bring the pawnbroker something that’s worth money to use as collateral and then you get a loan for a fraction of its value. Then, you have 90 days to repay the loan, plus interest and fees.

Jamaica: How do I redeem my item?

Nolan: You just show them your pawn ticket.

Jamaica: That sounds pretty simple. What if I can’t repay the money by the deadline?

Nolan: Then you forfeit your item. The pawnshop tries to sell it to recoup the money they lent you.

Jamaica: Okay, I’m going to do it. I’m going to pawn my collection.

Nolan: Your collection of what?

Jamaica: Action figures. I have the entire collection of ESL Podcast action figures. There’s Jeff, Lucy, Warren, Jessica, Adriano, Pao, LeeAnn, Alison . . .

Nolan: I said something worth money, remember?

### 1127 Paying for College

Chris: Which colleges are you applying to?

Marcella: None. I can’t afford to go to college. Even if I lived at home, tuition, fees, and books are just too expensive.

Chris: You could apply for financial aid.

Marcella: I don’t want to get a bunch of loans and be in debt for the next 10 to 20 years. It’s not worth it.

Chris: Loans aren’t so bad, especially ones that are federally subsidized. Apart from that, you could get need-based grants or work-study. Put all of that together and college can be affordable.

Marcella: I don’t want to go into debt of any kind.

Chris: You could go to a community college and transfer to a four-year university after two years. Community college tuition is much lower.

Marcella: But who has the time? I have to work full-time to pay my bills.

Chris: Then think about a program that has a service commitment.

Marcella: What do you mean?

Chris: There are teaching, military, or community service programs that will forgive or pay off your loans if you work for the organization for a few years after graduating.

Marcella: And be an indentured servant? No, thank you!

Chris: Okay, but most good jobs nowadays require a college degree.

Marcella: Not if you really have talent.

Chris: Talent?

Marcella: Yeah, haven’t you seen me mime? That’s my ticket to a great career.

Chris: I’m happy to hear you have such a practical plan mapped out for your future.

### 1128 Store Promotions and Giveaways

Sonia: What is all this?

Paul: These are entry forms and materials for our new store promotions and giveaways.

Sonia: What prizes can people win?

Paul: There are different kinds, because we’re running several promotions at once. We have scratch-off cards to win instant prizes, including t-shirts.

Sonia: Those t-shirts are really nice. I’d like one of those.

Paul: We also have a collect-and-win game. People collect codes printed on our products. When they’ve collected a certain number, they win gift certificates to spend in our store.

Sonia: Wow, that’s great. I’d like a gift certificate.

Paul: We also have a sweepstake. Enter to win one of three grand prizes: a TV, a Hawaiian vacation, and a brand new car!

Sonia: Wow, I definitely want one of those.

Paul: Do you know what you can do to win?

Sonia: No, what?

Paul: Quit your job. The rules say that employees and their families are not eligible.

Sonia: I don’t suppose I can find a way around that.

Paul: Not unless you’re considering divorcing your husband or disowning your children.

### 1129 Experiencing Virtual Reality

Tatiana: Why are you wearing those funny goggles?

Moustafa: I’m trying out a new kind of virtual reality.

Tatiana: You mean like flight simulators?

Moustafa: This is much more sophisticated. This system creates a complete sensory experience. I can see, hear, feel, and nearly taste this 3-D simulation.

Tatiana: I don’t see how it can do that.

Moustafa: With the help of these goggles and headphones, this computer program recreates what it’s like to actually be in a particular place, at a particular time. It even allows me to interact with different people and things.

Tatiana: I can see how that would be useful for gaming, but...

Moustafa: It’s not only for gaming. It’s useful for a host of other things, including relaxation. For instance, right now I’m experiencing what it’s like to be outdoors with the sun shining and the birds chirping.

Tatiana: If you open the door, you’ll see that the sun is shining and the birds are chirping.

Moustafa: Yes, but with virtual reality, I may never have to get out of this chair again. Now isn’t that progress?

### 1130 Eating Breakfast Foods

Emil: Look at this breakfast buffet. Wow, I’ve died and gone to heaven!

Tammy: I think I’ll just grab some cereal, fruit, and a bagel.

Emil: What?! How can you pass up this amazing buffet? I’m starting with some bacon, scrambled eggs, and hash browns.

Tammy: I don’t normally eat a big breakfast. If I’m still hungry after this, I’ll have some pancakes.

Emil: Pancakes! I’m going to have some pancakes when I’m done with this first round, plus some waffles and French toast.

Tammy: Well, more power to you. I can’t imagine anyone eating more than what’s already on your plate.

Emil: I’ve only just begun. After the pancakes, waffles, and French toast, I think I’ll have an omelet and some biscuits and gravy. I might even have room for one or two of those doughnuts.

Tammy: You’re not serious.

Emil: I’m dead serious.

Tammy: You sound like you’re planning on staying here all morning.

Emil: That’s right. Do you want to meet me back here for the lunch buffet?

### 1131 Visiting an Archaeological Site

Lillian: Look at this! I’m going to take this home as a souvenir.

Bruce: You can’t do that. That might be an artifact of some kind. It belongs to this archaeological site.

Lillian: It’s just a rock. No one will miss it.

Bruce: That’s not the point. Everything here should be preserved. That’s the point of doing a careful excavation. Everything should be recorded and nothing should be lost.

Lillian: Take it easy. It’s not like I’m defacing anything. And if they’re trying to preserve this site, why are they doing this dig? Wouldn’t it be better just to leave it frozen in time?

Bruce: The point is to learn more about the peoples of ancient civilizations who lived here in prehistory.

Lillian: In my opinion, it’s disrespectful to disturb burial mounds and tombs. They were never meant to be desecrated like this.

Bruce: Some people would agree with you, but that’s the price we have to pay to add to our knowledge about human history. I really think you should leave that rock where you found it. It could be a fossil.

Lillian: Do you really think so?

Bruce: You never know. You could hold in your hand the key to understanding this entire civilization.

Lillian: Wow, if I take it, I could preserve it for posterity.

Bruce: What happened to leaving things undisturbed?

Lillian: That’s before I realized I could go down in history for my own discovery!

### 1132 Defending Your Ideas at Work

Monica: That’s why I don’t think it’s doable. We should consider other ideas.
. . .

That was Monica. She’s my co-worker and my nemesis. She criticizes all of my ideas, but I’ve learned that the best defense is to not get defensive.
. . .

Kazuya: I appreciate your feedback. I understand your reservations, but let me show you these figures I’ve worked up, which I believe will address your concerns.
. . .

I knew Monica would attack my ideas, so I had come prepared.
. . .

Monica: That’s all very impressive, but I still think we need to consider other options.
. . .

Unfortunately, when Monica digs in her heels, I know that the only thing to do is to placate her. That plus a delaying tactic usually works.
. . .

Kazuya: Your comments have given me a lot to think about. We’re running short on time and we want to get to the other topics for discussion, so let’s come back to it next week.
. . .

Luckily, I know something else about Monica: She has a short attention span. By next week, she’ll be on to her next victim!

### 1133 Getting Immunizations Required by Schools

Jonas: Hi, Jenny. Are you getting your kids ready for school, too?

Jenny: Yes, as you can see, we’re buying lots of school supplies.

Jonas: Did you get the school letter reminding parents to submit proof of immunization before the first day of school? I know that your youngest is starting school this year.

Jenny: Yes, she is, but I’m thinking of getting an exemption. I’m not sure vaccines are safe, and I don’t want to take a chance with her health.

Jonas: The immunizations required by the school are standard – measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio – all vaccines your other children have had.

Jenny: But when I looked at the list, there were a few I didn’t recognize – diphtheria, hepatitis, and rubella. Who knows what our kids are getting!

Jonas: The ones you mentioned are standard, too. Don’t you remember the outbreak of whooping cough last year? If our kids had been immunized, they wouldn’t have gotten sick.

Jenny: I’ve read somewhere that vaccines might be dangerous. I just don’t want to jeopardize their future.

Jonas: That’s precisely what you’d be doing if you opted out of immunizations.

Jenny: Why’s that?

Jonas: Because your children won’t be getting an education. The school is barring any children who don’t get immunized from attending school.

Jenny: I call that irresponsible!

Jonas: That’s exactly the word that came to my mind.

### 1134 Describing Position and Location Within a Group

Selena: Don’t look now, but a big group of mothers are coming to this house to give you a piece of their mind.

Justin: What?! I meant it as a joke. I didn’t mean anything by it.

Selena: You’ll have to tell that to Sally. She’s at the head of the group and she’s flanked by Maria and Veronica.

Justin: Oh no, not them. I’d rather be confronted by anyone but those three.

Selena: They’re not the only ones. They’re backed by a group of at least 15 parents.

Justin: Maybe some of those on the periphery are just spectators, waiting to see what the rest of the group will do.

Selena: Don’t count on it. They look determined.

Justin: Who are those in the back?

Selena: Those bringing up the rear? I think those are a few fathers with a message of their own.

Justin: What should I do now?

Selena: Start by waving a white flag.

Justin: And then?

Selena: Try a sincere apology, with a healthy dose of groveling.

### 1135 Having Hearing Problems

Bernadette: Why are you mumbling?

Claude: I’m not. I said, “What’s wrong with your hearing?”

Bernadette: Nothing is wrong with my hearing. You just need to speak up.

Claude: I’m practically shouting. You need to see a doctor about your hearing loss.

Bernadette: I’m not hard of hearing. It’s probably just a buildup of earwax.

Claude: This is more serious than earwax. Do you hear ringing in your ears?

Bernadette: Not more than usual.

Claude: Meaning you usually hear ringing sounds?

Bernadette: Sure, who doesn’t?

Claude: Uh, normal people. Have you been asking people to repeat themselves? Are you having trouble hearing people when there’s a lot of background noise?

Bernadette: Maybe.

Claude: It might be something as simple as an infection, but it could be more serious, like damage to your eardrum or inner ear if you can’t hear sounds at low decibels.

Bernadette: I am not getting a hearing aid.

Claude: Would you prefer people to yell?

Bernadette: What?! Smell? You think I smell? Well, that’s just rude!

### 1136 Missing a Deadline

Oliver: I’ve just had to tell a client that I’m running behind and I won’t make the deadline.

Alena: How did she take it?

Oliver: Not so well, at first. I knew she wouldn’t be happy, so I’ve been in a dilemma for days: Should I tell her now that I’m going to miss the deadline, or wait until the deadline had passed.

Alena: For what it’s worth, I think you did the right thing. It gives her advance notice in case it affects other parts of her project.

Oliver: That’s what I thought, too. I also offered to make up for any inconvenience the delay would cause.

Alena: Did she take you up on it?

Oliver: No, she said that giving me a three-day extension wouldn’t set her back, but if it dragged on for longer than that, it would put her in an awkward spot, and she would let me know.

Alena: I’m glad you came to an understanding. So you’ll have it done by the new deadline, right?

Oliver: Yes, even if I have to do without sleep, food, or bathroom breaks for the next week.

Alena: That’s very dedicated of you, though potentially messy.

### 1137 Using Battery Power

Luisa: The battery on my computer is almost out of juice.

Allesandro: Did you bring a spare?

Luisa: It’s a rechargeable battery, so instead of replacing it, I need to plug it in, but there are no outlets in here.

Allesandro: I don’t see one either.

Luisa: Forget it. I’ll just finish watching the movie on my phone. Oh no, my phone battery is running low, too. It’s a high-capacity battery and is supposed to discharge slowly, giving me a full day of power. I don’t know what’s wrong with it.

Allesandro: Do you want to borrow my radio? At least you can listen to music for a while.

Luisa: A radio? You mean an old-fashioned radio?

Allesandro: Yeah, it uses disposable batteries and I brought plenty.

Luisa: No, thanks. I don’t think a radio will do me any good. Maybe there’s an emergency generator around here. I just need enough electricity to finish watching my movie.

Allesandro: I don’t think that will do you any good, and plus, the emergency generator is supposed to be used for emergencies and only in the event of a power failure.

Luisa: Exactly! What can be more of an emergency than not knowing how a movie ends?

### 1138 Dating Nice Guys and Bad Boys

Jack: I’ve had it. I’m going to start treating women like dirt. I’d get more dates.

Alison: What brought this on?

Jack: I got dumped again by a woman who thinks I’m too nice – too nice! She says she wants to be with someone who’s more assertive and unpredictable. She didn’t say it in so many words, but that means she thinks I’m a wimp and I’m boring.

Alison: My guess is she wants a bad boy. A lot of women go through that phase. We want excitement and drama, the thrill of the chase.

Jack: You mean they choose to be with selfish, irresponsible jerks because it’s exciting?

Alison: I hate to say it, but it’s true. But I’m telling you, this phase doesn’t last in most women. When we want to settle down, that’s when we look for the nice guys.

Jack: You mean I have to wait until then to get a nice girlfriend?

Alison: No, I simply mean that until then, nice guys finish last.

Jack: Well, I’m not willing to wait.

Alison: Where are you going?

Jack: I’m going to work on my swagger and my sneer.

### 1139 Major Historical Periods

Livy: Tell me again why we’re here on a Saturday afternoon.

Nicholas: You’re going to love this museum. It has artifacts and exhibits from all the major periods in history, from prehistoric days to the present.

Livy: Hmm, fascinating.

Nicholas: It is, isn’t it? We follow the timeline of human history from one room to the next. See? This room is devoted to ancient history and ancient civilizations.

Livy: Is there a gift shop?

Nicholas: Sure, there’s one on the way out, but let me show you a few things in this room. It’s all about the Middle Ages. Check this out. Doesn’t it blow your mind?

Livy: Yeah, wow, great. Actually, it’s all kind of dull. Isn’t there something more exciting to see?

Nicholas: You want excitement? Then let’s skip ahead to the rooms on the Renaissance. Look at this!

Livy: This is all great, but I’ve seen enough. Let’s keep going.

Nicholas: We’re rushing past the best exhibits, but if you want to keep going, I guess we can do that. These next rooms are devoted to more recent history, the Industrial Revolution and pre- and post-World War years.

Livy: Is there anything else?

Nicholas: You mean you’re done looking at over 3,000 years of historical exhibits? This is one of the best museums in the world. I could spend all weekend here.

Livy: That’s because you’re a history buff. Hey, that room is about the Information Age. Do you think I can check my email in there?

Nicholas: [sigh]

### 1140 Dealing With a Language Barrier

Carol: Send another memo to the Gibberese office. I think we have our wires crossed again.

Art: Don’t you think it would be better to call the office and speak to someone there? You might be able to get to the bottom of the misunderstanding more quickly.

Carol: I don’t speak Gibberish and we don’t have anyone bilingual in the office to act as an interpreter.

Art: Which means there’s no one who could translate our correspondence into Gibberish to make things easier.

Carol: That’s right. And plus, leaving a paper trail is better.

Art: You mean in case we have to cover our asses.

Carol: I wouldn’t put it like that, but breakdowns in communication are inevitable and it’s always helpful to be able to trace their source.

Art: Right. Okay, I’ll draft a memo and pass it by you before I send it, okay?

Carol: Sounds good.

Art: What I don’t understand is why we don’t simply hire people for this office who are fluent in Gibberish.

Carol: Do you know anyone who speaks Gibberish?

Art: Plenty!

### 1141 Proofreading a Document

Russell: Hey, LeeAnn, you were an English major, right?

LeeAnn: Yes.

Russell: Could you proofread this for me?

LeeAnn: I don’t know. Do you want me to proof it for content or for structure?

Russell: For everything.

LeeAnn: So you’re asking me to fact-check all of the facts and figures and to parse each line to find any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.

Russell: That’s right. I used the spell-check on it, but some typos may have slipped through. I wouldn’t be surprised if it were riddled with other errors, too.

LeeAnn: Right. What about the formatting?

Russell: Check that, too. You can edit out the errors as you go along.

LeeAnn: You want me to proofread and edit it?

Russell: Sure, if you don’t mind.

LeeAnn: You do realize that this is a 400-page document, right?

Russell: Is there a problem?

### 1142 A Boating Accident

Liset: I should never have gotten on this boat. We’re going to sink. I know it!

Mark: Calm down. The water is a little rough today, but there’s nothing to worry about. You have your life jacket on, right?

Liset: Oh my God, water is splashing into the boat. We need to start bailing right now!

Mark: Don’t be ridiculous. That’s just a little sea spray. Sit down and relax.

Liset: Look out! There’s another boat over there!

Mark: It’s just passing by. We might feel its wake, but we’re not going to capsize. I promise you that.

Liset: How long do you think we can survive adrift on the water?

Mark: We are not going to sink. I’m telling you.

Liset: I wonder how long we’ll be marooned on an island. I hope to see my family again someday.

Mark: All right, we’ll return to the shore. It’s clear that you’re not enjoying this.

Liset: I didn’t know we’d be sailing in the middle of a squall.

Mark: There’s a gentle breeze today, that’s all. I’m sorry I didn’t wait for a completely calm day to take you out on your first boat ride.

Liset: My first and last!

### 1143 Repairing an Appliance

Virginia: Hand me that screwdriver, will you?

Alonso: Don’t tell me you’re trying to fix that dryer yourself. We need to call in an authorized repairman or repairwoman.

Virginia: Do you have any idea what they’ll charge?

Alonso: All right, then I’ll call a handyman and see if he knows anything about fixing dryers.

Virginia: If he doesn’t, he might make matters worse. I think it’s just a matter of clearing a clog or replacing a worn component.

Alonso: Yes, but which one? We should just upgrade to a newer model.

Virginia: This dryer does not need to be replaced. It’s not that old.

Alonso: But it’s been on the fritz on and off for a year.

Virginia: I don’t want to throw out a perfectly good appliance just because of a minor problem.

Alonso: Well, this “minor problem” is the reason I had to walk to work in damp clothes this morning.

Virginia: That wasn’t so bad, was it?

Alonso: In the middle of winter?! You try walking with icicles in the most uncomfortable places!

### 1144 Being Assertive and Meek

Victor: We need to take the bull by the horns. In the meeting today, we’re going to give it to them straight, no more hemming and hawing.

Maura: You’re right. We need to tell them what we really think and be done with it.

Victor: Definitely. We’ve been conciliatory long enough. Today, we need to be insistent without being too pushy.

Maura: Being unassuming and deferential has its place, but not if we seem meek. We need to be assertive without being too in-your-face.

Victor: You’re absolutely right. One of us has to speak up.

Maura: Yes, one of us has to be bold. They’ll have to take us seriously this time.

Victor: Okay, ready?

Maura: Sure, I have your back.

Victor: Huh? I thought you were going to do the talking.

Maura: Uh, I thought you were.

Victor: Maybe we should wait for the next meeting to take them on.

Maura: I totally agree. It’ll give us a little time to work up to it.

Victor: Exactly!

### 1145 Using Herbs and Spices in Cooking

Gisela: That smells wonderful!

Danny: This is my family’s recipe. The secret is in the combination of seasonings we use.

Gisela: I can see that. You must have 30 different dried and fresh herbs and spices on this counter.

Danny: To get a bold flavor, we use a lot of aromatic seeds, barks, and roots.

Gisela: How much do you put in of each one?

Danny: Precise measurements aren’t really necessary. I put in a pinch of this and a dash of that. I add them to taste.

Gisela: So getting the recipe wouldn’t do me any good, huh?

Danny: I’m afraid not. I learned how to make this in my mother’s kitchen.

Gisela: Would you teach me if I volunteered to be your apprentice, doing all of your prep work?

Danny: That depends.

Gisela: On what?

Danny: On how quick you are with this potato peeler.

### 1146 Negotiating With a Street Vendor

Sean: Just look at the quality of that. You won’t find a finer one anywhere.

Patrice: It’s nice, but it’s more than I want to spend.

Sean: Okay, just for you, I’ll knock off 10 percent. What do you say?

Patrice: I think it’s still too pricey. I think I’ll pass.

Sean: Wait! Don’t be so hasty. What you have there is a one-of-a-kind item. You don’t want to pass up something this special.

Patrice: I’ll think about it . . .

Sean: How about if I throw in a second one for the same price, a two-for-one offer?

Patrice: I thought you said this was one of a kind.

Sean: Did I? I meant to say that there aren’t many out there like it. I just happen to have two. How about it?

Patrice: I think I’ll shop around first.

Sean: This offer is only good right now, so don’t walk away.

Patrice: Like I said, I’ll think about it . . .

Sean: All right. Name your price. Make me a reasonable offer and I’ll let you have it.

Patrice: How about 30 percent off?

Sean: That’s highway robbery! I’m just a street vendor trying to make a living here.

Patrice: Take it or leave it.

Sean: All right, you have a deal. You drive a hard bargain. You wouldn’t be looking for a job, would you?

### 1147 Types of Students in School

Cheech: Is this your old yearbook?

Boo: Yeah, I found it while cleaning out my closet.

Cheech: Look at your picture! You look like you were an honor roll student.

Boo: Don’t be fooled. I was just an average student, not the valedictorian, but not a dropout either.

Cheech: Who is that? She’s very pretty.

Boo: That’s my friend Marlene. In high school, she was good at everything. She had a high GPA and took every available AP class.

Cheech: So she was a nerd.

Boo: No, not at all. She was also a jock, a member of lots of student clubs, and was student body president.

Cheech: Wow, she must have been popular.

Boo: She was, but she wasn’t stuck-up. She got along with everybody, not just the football players and cheerleaders. She was friends with geeks and goths, too. Everybody liked her.

Cheech: Where is she now? Do you still keep in touch?

Boo: Yes, of course. She’s doing very well and is very successful.

Cheech: And single?

Boo: Yeah, but you’re not her type.

Cheech: And what type is that?

Boo: You? Definitely a druggie.

### 1148 Distinctive Facial Features

Mona: How is the portrait coming along?

Leonardo: I’m done with the sketches and I’m ready to start on the painting.

Mona: This commission is quite a godsend for a new artist. If you do a good job with this portrait, you may get other commissions.

Leonardo: It’s all the same to me. I paint them as I see them.

Mona: Well, I hope not exactly as you see them. A portrait has to be flattering, doesn’t it?

Leonardo: You mean I should downplay bulging eyes, hooked noses, and double chins? No way. That’s what makes each face distinctive.

Mona: Maybe that isn’t the best way to think about it. Everybody has an image of themselves in their mind’s eye. You would just be capturing that image.

Leonardo: I’m an artist, not a psychologist. If they have squinty eyes, ears that stick out, a weak chin, or thin lips, that’s what I’m going to paint.

Mona: But this sketch shows a really prominent forehead and a receding hairline. Maybe you could just . . .

Leonardo: No! I have to be true to my art. I’m not compromising.

Mona: [sigh] I was just hoping you could finally make enough money to move off of my couch!

### 1149 Delaying Making a Decision

Thomas: You’ve hemmed and hawed for weeks. It’s time to make a decision.

Eugenia: I know, but I need to sleep on it. This is a very big decision.

Thomas: You’ve dragged your feet for far too long. Are you having second thoughts?

Eugenia: No, no second thoughts. I just want to be absolutely sure I’m making the right choice. I’m on the fence between two options. We’ll have to live with this decision for years.

Thomas: I thought you’d already made a tentative decision days ago.

Eugenia: No, no, no. In my mind, the jury is still out.

Thomas: You can’t leave everyone hanging.

Eugenia: I know that, but how can I choose if I’m not 100 percent positive about either option.

Thomas: I understand that, but it’s now down to the wire. You’ve got to bite the bullet and decide.

Eugenia: I know. If only I had a few more days to think about it . . .

Thomas: Too late. They’re here.

Eugenia: The painters are here?

Thomas: Yes. So will this be a blue or green house?

Eugenia: How about stripes?

### 1150 Avoiding Topics in Conversation

Lila: Why aren’t you dating? I have so many friends who would love to go out with you.

George: Let’s change the subject. Talking about my love life isn’t very interesting.

Lila: But really, you’re not getting any younger and . . .

George: Moving on! Have you seen any good movies lately?

Lila: Listen, all of your friends are settling down and you don’t want to go through life alone and lonely . . .

George: That reminds me, didn’t you say that you were going to get another dog so that Rover isn’t lonely when you’re not home?

Lila: Forget about my dog. You remember Rachel, don’t you? She just broke up with her boyfriend and she’d be perfect for you.

George: Speaking of Rachel, how is her mother? Wasn’t she in the hospital?

Lila: If Rachel isn’t your type, how about Amina? She has great legs and I know you’re a leg man.

George: And now for something completely different . . . How is your diet coming along? Have you lost any weight yet?

Lila: I don’t really want to talk about my weight.

George: But I think you’re having trouble shedding those pounds, right? I have lots of suggestions on what you can do.

Lila: Anyway, as I said before, I don’t really want to talk about my diet . . .

George: You need to cut out sweets if you want to lose weight. Are you eating too many sweets?

Lila: That’s none of your business!

George: My sentiments exactly!

### 1151 Working as a Street Performer

Giancarlo: Whoa, where are you going? I thought we were going to hang out.

Alana: I’m going to work.

Giancarlo: Work? I didn’t know you got a job.

Alana: I’m busking on Main Street.

Giancarlo: You mean you’re panhandling? That’s not working.

Alana: I’m not panhandling. I’m working for tips. I perform, try to draw a crowd, and then pass the hat.

Giancarlo: Can you really make money that way?

Alana: You’d be surprised. I got the idea from Danielle and her friends. A group of them do street theater and comedy routines. A friend of theirs juggles and does acrobatics. Another guy does magic tricks.

Giancarlo: And they do all this on the street? Don’t they get hassled by the cops?

Alana: The cops occasionally tell them to move along or tell the crowd to disperse, but if they’re respectful and nobody complains, they get left alone. Hey wait, where are you going?

Giancarlo: I’m going with you. I want to give this street performing a try.

Alana: What can you do?

Giancarlo: I’m a man of many talents.

Alana: Are you?

Giancarlo: Don’t look so surprised!

### 1152 Collecting Debt

Ken: Look at this list of customers who still owe us money. How is this business supposed to survive if we keep extending credit?

Marjorie: We started doing it because some of our best customers didn’t have ready cash. They’re good for it.

Ken: I know they’ll eventually pay their outstanding debt, but what are we supposed to do in the meantime? We need that cash to buy stock.

Marjorie: We can call in the debt and set a deadline for repayment. We can give those who are really hard up an extension on a case-by-case basis.

Ken: What if they still don’t pay? We’d have to turn it over to a collection agency. We’d only get 40 cents on the dollar, but we’ll have to close our doors if we don’t collect.

Marjorie: Using a collection agency would be a last resort. I’ll call each of our major debtors and have a talk with them. I’m sure they’ll come through.

Ken: I hope you’re right or we will be the ones asking for credit!

### 1153 Getting Advice from Mothers-in-Law

Marc: Who was that?

Carla: It was your mother – again. She wanted to give me another piece of unsolicited advice about housekeeping. She’s called five times this week already.

Marc: She’s just trying to be helpful.

Carla: I wish she’d do it without being so critical. I feel like she enjoys finding fault with everything I do.

Marc: She’s a little overeager to help, that’s all. Don’t think of it as her interfering. Think of it as her giving you support. She isn’t like your mother.

Carla: What do you mean?

Marc: What do I mean?! She’s constantly giving me advice on how to be a better husband.

Carla: Well, we just got married and she wants our marriage to be the best it can be.

Marc: I know, but your mother has a really sharp tongue and she doesn’t hold back. She butts in whenever I’m trying to do something to tell me how to do it better.

Carla: Just like your mother, she’s only trying to help.

Marc: With her constant sarcastic comments?

Carla: That’s just her sense of humor. She doesn’t mean anything by it. She likes you.

Marc: She has a strange way of showing it.

Carla: All of this talk about mothers-in-law is getting our blood up. At this rate, we won’t be able to follow the best piece of marriage advice we’ve received so far.

Marc: Which was?

Carla: Don’t go to bed angry.

Marc: Who’s angry?

### 1154 Visiting Historic Sites

Mary: I think we should call it a day.

Will: I think we still have time to visit one more historic site and this one is amazing. They’ve done a great job with preservation and restoration.

Mary: It’s not another old castle, is it?

Will: It’s not any old castle. This one dates back to the 1300s. If we’re lucky, we’ll be in time for the last guided tour with a docent who’s knowledgeable. And I hope we have time to visit the archives, too.

Mary: Oh no, not the archives.

Will: I wonder if they’re doing reenactments to commemorate any major historical events during our time here?

Mary: If we visit this castle today, we’re not coming back. There is a lot to see in this city other than old castles and monuments.

Will: Like what?

Mary: Like art museums and stores. It would also be nice to relax a little while on vacation.

Will: But what’s art and shopping when you’re in one of the most ancient cities in the world? And there’s no time to relax. We only have four days here. We have to make the most of it. Hey, where are you going?

Mary: I think it’s time to split up. You go see your castle and I’ll explore on my own.

Will: But you won’t get the full benefits of being in one of the most ancient cities in the world.

Mary: I think I’ll survive.

### 1155 Getting an Online Degree

Carlos: So where are you planning on attending college?

Torrie: I’ve picked Harford University.

Carlos: The only Harford University I’ve heard of is a degree mill.

Torrie: I’m sure it’s not the same one. The Harford University I’m attending is accredited, at least I’m pretty sure it is. The best part of going to Harford is I’ll never have to attend classes on campus. I can do all of my coursework online.

Carlos: You want to attend an online university? There are some legitimate ones that offer good distance education, but many have low admissions standards and don’t provide a very good education.

Torrie: Not Harford. It’s a good degree-granting institution, and they even give you credit for relevant life experience. I won’t need to take very many courses to graduate.

Carlos: That sounds pretty fishy to me.

Torrie: Don’t worry. My transcript and degree will be indistinguishable from those from a traditional university, without nearly as much work.

Carlos: That should tell you something. How is their job placement rate?

Torrie: I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be as competitive as any other college graduate.

Carlos: If you say so. What are you doing right now?

Torrie: I’m playing a video game stealing cars. At Harford, that’s considered relevant life experience. Cool, huh?

Carlos: Yeah, cool.

### 1156 Unsafe Factory Conditions

Kathy Lee: You won’t find any problems in your inspection of our factory.

Rashed: I’m glad to hear that. Where do these stairs lead?

Kathy Lee: It’s just a level for storage. You don’t need to see that.

Rashed: I need to inspect every part of this factory. Please step aside.

Kathy Lee: If you insist.

Rashed: You have people working on this floor and it’s not structurally sound, and certainly not intended for heavy manufacturing. This attic was never meant for industrial use.

Kathy Lee: It’s only temporary . . .

Rashed: There are no fire escapes, fire extinguishers, or emergency exits.

Kathy Lee: Well, I . . .

Rashed: None of the workers are wearing protective clothing and I see signs of child labor.

Kathy Lee: No, no, no, I wouldn’t hire anyone underage.

Rashed: I am ordering an immediate shutdown of this factory due to flagrant violations of building code and labor laws.

Kathy Lee: But you can’t do that! We have orders to fill.

Rashed: Not when this building is in danger of imminent collapse.

### 1157 Describing Nudity

Venus: Kids, cover your eyes! Don’t look at that. I didn’t know there would be nudity here. Why did you bring us here?

Milo: I brought you here to see this celebration of the beauty of the human form.

Venus: This is obscene! Look at the bare breasts on that one and the one over there is topless. That man’s private parts are on display for everyone to see. Most of these are butt naked!

Milo: Can’t you see past the nudity to appreciate the artists’ creations?

Venus: I’m not one of those people who go to nude beaches and run around in their birthday suit completely uninhibited. This is shameful!

Milo: This isn’t a nude beach. It’s a museum. Your kids are here to appreciate some of the finest art in history.

Venus: I don’t call this art. I call it pornography. I’m taking my kids out of here. Oh my God, there are full frontals wherever you look! Kids, keep your eyes covered. We’re leaving.

Milo: All right, but I was just trying to open your kids’ eyes to art.

Venus: You’ve opened their eyes all right, and I’m slamming them shut!

### 1158 Cold Weather Complaints

Boris: Come on, keep climbing! This is the best exercise you’ll get all winter.

Kay: My face hurts and I can’t stop shivering.

Boris: If we pick up the pace, you’ll warm up.

Kay: I doubt it. I can feel my core body temperature dipping. I feel hypothermia coming on.

Boris: Don’t be silly. You’re dressed in layers, with fabric that wicks moisture away from your skin and insulates your body from the cold. The worst you’re going to get are dry skin and cracked lips.

Kay: Then why do I feel pins and needles in my hands and numbness in my feet?

Boris: Maybe you’re just getting used to the cold. You’ll feel warmer in a minute.

Kay: But what if they’re signs of frostbite? I think I’ll turn back before I freeze.

Boris: And miss out on these awe-inspiring winter views?

Kay: I prefer the awe-inspiring views of a blazing fire!

### 1159 Describing the Fit of Clothing

Vera: How do these pants look on me?

Wang: Uh, aren’t they a little too tight? They look like they’re cutting off circulation in your legs.

Vera: They’re a little snug, but they show off my curves, don’t they?

Wang: I suggest going up a size. Something a little less formfitting would be a lot more comfortable.

Vera: I’m not going for comfort. I’m going for style.

Wang: Here, try these pants. They’re looser and offer more room.

Vera: These don’t show my shape at all. They’re not in the least flattering.

Wang: But you can move in them without busting a seam.

Vera: You’re missing the point. I want to look good in these pants no matter what.

Wang: Spoken like a true slave to fashion!

### 1160 Being Reprimanded at Work

Tania: What time is your meeting with Ted?

James: It’s at 3:00. Why?

Tania: You don’t seem worried. If I were being accused of misconduct and up for disciplinary action, I’d be on edge.

James: It was a minor offense. I’m sure I’ll just get a slap on the wrist.

Tania: I heard about it and it didn’t sound that minor.

James: People blow things out of proportion. It’s not like I’ll be up for dismissal or anything.

Tania: I hope not, but you might get a written reprimand placed in your personnel file. That could affect your chances for a raise or promotion.

James: I don’t have much of a chance of getting either one, quite frankly, so why sweat it? I’ll deal with whatever punishment I get.

Tania: I’m glad that’s your attitude.

James: What I say is: Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time!

### 1161 Traveling by Light Rail

Jean: Look out!

Gordon: Don’t worry. That’s just a light rail train. The new light rail system shares the road with street traffic.

Jean: Phew! For a second there I thought we were going to collide with it.

Gordon: Didn’t you see the operator seated at the front of the train? She watches out for other drivers.

Jean: I didn’t know they have operators. I thought they were automatic.

Gordon: No, they’re not like some forms of rapid transit.

Jean: I see now that they ride on tracks and are powered by overhead electric lines.

Gordon: That’s right.

Jean: I’d like to give light rail a try.

Gordon: Really? Well, there’s no time like the present. I’ll take you to the nearest stop. There’s the platform over there.

Jean: But I thought you agreed to give me a ride into the city.

Gordon: And deprive you of a new travel experience? Never!

### 1162 Staying in an Inexpensive Hotel

Suzanna: Remind me why we’re staying in this fleabag motel in the seedy part of town?

Kenji: We agreed that we would skimp on the accommodations so we could spend more money on activities and eating out. Remember?

Suzanna: I remember, but I didn’t bargain for someplace as run-down as this. Look at the peeling wallpaper and moldy bathroom.

Kenji: It’s pretty bad, isn’t it? Look on the bright side. At least it’s not rat-infested.

Suzanna: That’s small comfort. Well, I think I’ll take a short nap before we go out for dinner. Uh!

Kenji: What’s the matter?

Suzanna: This comforter is filthy. I doubt housekeeping has changed it in months!

Kenji: Let’s get out of here and go get a drink. That should cheer us up.

Suzanna: Good idea. If I have more than one, maybe I won’t care so much where we’re staying.

Kenji: Given the state of this room, we might need an entire pitcher!

### 1163 Types of Religious Leaders

Mary: I feel like an idiot!

Alexei: Why? What happened?

Mary: I just called the bishop over there “Pope.”

Alexei: That’s not so bad. You gave him a promotion. At least you didn’t call him “Rabbi.”

Mary: Don’t laugh! When I agreed to work at this interfaith conference, I didn’t know I’d need a crash course in identifying religious leaders from their dress.

Alexei: It can’t be that hard. That man over there is clearly a cardinal, and the woman next to him is probably a minister by the look of her clerical collar.

Mary: What about the man in robes over there?

Alexei: He’s probably a lama or a guru. He’s definitely not an imam, but I’m not entirely sure how I would address him.

Mary: See what I mean? I keep saying the wrong thing.

Alexei: These religious leaders don’t expect laypeople like you and me to know as much as they do about religious dress.

Mary: That’s what you think! I called that man over there “Preacher” and he gave me a dirty look.

Alexei: No wonder. He’s the caterer.

### 1164 Making Office Renovations

Alice: I can’t hear you over that hammering. When are these renovations going to be done?

Dilbert: They’re already two weeks past the scheduled completion date and I can only guess at the cost overruns.

Alice: It feels like they’re never going to finish.

Dilbert: I know. When the renovations were announced, I was glad to hear that the office would be reconfigured for better use.

Alice: Me, too.

Dilbert: The upgrades sounded good – new lighting fixtures, flooring, and sound-deadening walls and ceilings.

Alice: I was looking forward to an updated look with new built-ins. This old furniture shows lots of wear and tear.

Dilbert: Yeah, now all I want is to be rid of all this dust. Who can work with this racket?

Alice: Heh? What did you say? Did you say you can’t hack it? Me, neither!

### 1165 Eating Spicy Foods

Akim: Oh, this is so good! Why are your eyes watering?

Wendy: It’s so spicy! When you invited me over for curry, I didn’t know it’d be so hot.

Akim: This is mild or maybe medium. I make another version of this that’s much hotter. In fact, I like mine with some extra peppers and some hot sauce. Do you want any?

Wendy: Are you kidding me?! The roof of my mouth is on fire.

Akim: You must have very sensitive taste buds. This has a little kick to it and it’s pungent and zesty, but it’s not too spicy.

Wendy: You must have no taste buds at all if you think this is mild. My mouth needs to cool down from all that heat. I need more water – now!

Akim: All right, but you don’t want to fill up on water. I’ve made a special dessert.

Wendy: Is that supposed to be mild, too?

Akim: No, that really is spicy!

### 1166 Discussing Philosophy

Rene: Why are you sitting here just staring into space?

Francis: I’m pondering life.

Rene: That sounds profound.

Francis: I’m examining my life from a metaphysical standpoint. I’m not sure I really exist. Maybe my entire life is an illusion and there’s no such thing as reality.

Rene: Okay. Are you sure you’re feeling all right?

Francis: I’m better now that I’ve made some decisions about my epistemological outlook on life. I’m allowing reason and logic to guide me.

Rene: That’s great, but you still seem a little distracted.

Francis: That’s because I’m wrestling with some major questions about ethics and morality. It’s not easy always trying to do the right thing.

Rene: I can understand that, but could you get me . . .

Francis: But then I think that perhaps the only thing that matters in life are esthetics, and I should devote my life to creating beauty.

Rene: That’s a nice idea, but have you given any thought to how you’d pay the rent? You could start by getting me a cup of coffee.

Francis: Ah, I see you’re a realist. Do you want your usual or do you want to hear the specials?

### 1167 Birth Order and Sibling Rivalries

Nancy: Isn’t this a great time of year? Families get together over the holidays.

Yasmani: Maybe it’s nice for some families, but I dread my family get-togethers.

Nancy: How come?

Yasmani: I have a big family and there has always been a lot of sibling rivalry.

Nancy: I’m sure that was true when you were growing up, but you’ve all grown out of it, haven’t you?

Yasmani: Not us. The firstborn still thinks he’s in charge, the middle children still act up to get attention, and the baby of the family is still rebellious.

Nancy: That’s true in a lot of families.

Yasmani: Yes, but when we get together, we compete to show up the others. We brag, argue, and nitpick. It’s rather pathetic, actually.

Nancy: How do your parents handle all that?

Yasmani: They’ve always left us to our own devices. We just fight it out amongst ourselves.

Nancy: So, there’s no loving bond between the siblings.

Yasmani: Oh, we love each other, but we compete with other, too. It’s complicated.

Nancy: Then I should be glad to be an only child?

Yasmani: That’s right. Count your blessings!

### 1168 Reading Contracts Carefully

Barbara: Just sign on the dotted line and be done with it.

Sean: Didn’t your parents ever teach you to read every document carefully before you sign it?

Barbara: Not when the contract is boilerplate. All of the terms are standard.

Sean: No, they’re not. Did you notice in the fine print that if the agreement is cancelled, we’re on the hook for additional charges?

Barbara: Really? No, I guess I missed that.

Sean: If you had gone through this document with a fine-tooth comb as I have, you would have noticed that there are loopholes for the other side to end the contract at any time.

Barbara: I guess I overlooked those.

Sean: And there are contingencies for problems on their end, but not on ours.

Barbara: Wow, I didn’t realize they were trying to screw us. Maybe we shouldn’t do business with them.

Sean: Relax. This is par for the course with this kind of contract. They try to sneak in all kinds of things, and it’s our job to find them. We just have to be vigilant, that’s all.

Barbara: Do you think this is going to take much longer? They’re waiting in the other room to finalize the agreement.

Sean: It’ll take as long as it takes. What do you think that cot is for?

### 1169 Being Talkative and Reserved

Marcia: Phew! I thought they’d never leave.

Artem: I enjoyed their company, didn’t you?

Marcia: Jessie is fine, a little reserved and soft-spoken, and on the shy side. Kelly, on the other hand, talked our ear off. No one could get a word in edgewise with her.

Artem: I thought Kelly’s anecdotes were funny. She was a little long-winded, I’ll admit, but I enjoyed talking to her more than trying to make conversation with Jessie. She is so closemouthed and guarded that it was like pulling teeth.

Marcia: I’d rather talk to someone who is a little reticent than a loudmouth.

Artem: Ooh, that’s a little harsh.

Marcia: Maybe you’re right, but I don’t like the blathering, gossipy type.

Artem: I wonder . . .

Marcia: What?

Artem: I wonder what they’re saying about us.

### 1170 Naming Children

Celeste: So, here is my shortlist.

Albert: A shortlist for what?

Celeste: Baby names.

Albert: We have months to decide. Don’t you think we should wait?

Celeste: No, I want to be prepared. Here, take a look. See what you think.

Albert: Ezekiel?! You want to name our child Ezekiel? He’ll be teased by every kid in school.

Celeste: It’s a family name. I was trying to appease my parents. They’ve been suggesting a lot of family names. We could call him by a nickname, maybe “Zeke.”

Albert: I’m not naming my child Ezekiel. His name would be Ezekiel Eckleman. That’s a mouthful. I also want to steer clear of alliterative names. I’ve never liked them.

Celeste: Okay, are there any names you like on my list?

Albert: Not Alan Phillip. That’s for sure.

Celeste: Why not? I thought we’d name the baby after my grandfather. Alan is a nice first name and Phillip is a nice middle name.

Albert: His initials would be “A.P.E.” – ape! He would never live that down.

Celeste: How about “Mikol”?

Albert: You mean an alternate spelling for “Michael”? People don’t know how to pronounce a name with an odd spelling.

Celeste: Well, are there any names you do like?

Albert: Albert Eckleman Junior has a nice ring to it.

Celeste: As you say, we have months to decide. Let’s keep an open mind.

Albert: Humph!

### 1171 Cancelling a Service

Diana: You’ve reached customer service for Bully Services. How may I help you today?

Phillip: I’d like to cancel my service.

Diana: Why do you want to cancel?

Phillip: I’m switching to another company with cheaper services. I’m no longer under contract, so there should be no early-termination penalties.

Diana: Let’s take a look at your account. I’m sure we can make you an offer so you won’t want to discontinue service.

Phillip: I’ve made up my mind. I just want to cancel.

Diana: As a customer service rep, it’s my job to find a way to retain you as a valued customer. Please bear with me, sir.

Phillip: Really, I’m not interested in any offers you can make. No high-pressure tactics are going to work with me, so please just cancel my service.

Diana: Please, sir, be reasonable. I’m trying to work with you so you won’t miss out on our great deals. If you sign a new two-year contract or set up auto-pay, I can offer you . . .

Phillip: I’m not interested. I want to cancel – now!

Diana: Just let me tell you about these three plans that are available to you at a lower price. I know that deep down you don’t really want to cancel your service.

Phillip: I do want to cancel my service and I want to do it right now!

Diana: Sir, please! You’re being a little pushy.

Phillip: I’m being a little pushy?!

### 1172 Booking Space for Business Events

Roberto: All right, we have to find meeting rooms and a banquet hall for the annual sales meeting and luncheon. Do you have any ideas?

Nicole: We could hold it at a hotel as we’ve done in past years, or we can try the convention center.

Roberto: The company has grown so much in the past year. I don’t think the hotel has the capacity we need. The convention center sounds like a better option.

Nicole: The advantage of the hotel is that it has in-house catering and waitstaff for the luncheon.

Roberto: Yes, but we can bring in outside catering, which would give us more food options. The large convention center rooms will also allow us to configure the space the way we want it.

Nicole: But the hotel meeting rooms have built-in A/V. I’m not sure that’s available at the convention center.

Roberto: All right, I think we should visit both venues and book after we’ve met with the event managers. Agreed?

Nicole: Agreed. And we’ll need to sample the catering options, right?

Roberto: Of course. What are expense accounts for?

### 1173 Flying on a Budget Airline

Anton: It’s amazing that we were able to get these airline tickets so cheaply.

Federica: It’s great, isn’t it? We can fly to Lawrence City for a fun weekend. Let’s check in using this kiosk.

Anton: Hmm, this is asking me to pay $50 to bring a piece of luggage aboard. I didn’t know there were such strict baggage restrictions.

Federica: I didn’t realize it either.

Anton: And we have to pay another fee to reserve a seat. I didn’t know that the default was open seating.

Federica: Me, neither.

Anton: Did you know that we’re not flying directly to Lawrence City, but making two stops on the way?

Federica: Oh, no!

Anton: And there are other hidden fees for what they consider add-ons, things we would normally get for free on other airlines, like a soda, snack, blanket, and in-flight entertainment?

Federica: No, that’s news to me.

Anton: Here’s the kicker. We’re not flying into Lawrence City Airport but to a remote airport 60 miles away. We’ll pay a lot for ground transportation to our hotel. Should we get a refund and forget about the trip?

Federica: Sorry, one thing I do know is that there are no refunds or changes allowed.

Anton: I should have known flying on a budget airline would be like this. It doesn’t seem like such a good deal now, does it?

Federica: No, this airline has turned nickel-and-diming into an art form!

### 1174 Describing Video Quality

Amelia: I wish we had hired a professional videographer to film it instead of asking your friend Lenny to do it.

Victor: This video isn’t so bad. The production quality isn’t the best, but he did a pretty good job.

Amelia: It’s not bad if you like your video out of focus. There are no transitions between scenes and the lighting is terrible. At best, it looks like a rough cut.

Victor: It is a little rough, I admit.

Amelia: There are problems with the audio, too. There are sections of dead air when the audio cuts out. And when there is audio, the volume isn’t uniform.

Victor: That’s true, too, I guess . . .

Amelia: And the handheld camera footage is so shaky that I feel ill watching it.

Victor: Lenny was just having a good time, getting into the spirit of it.

Amelia: Is that why he got close-up shots of all of the pretty women and none of the other guests?

Victor: Well, you know Lenny. He’ll do better next time.

Amelia: Next time?! How many times do you plan to get married?

### 1175 Getting a Fresh Start

Nico: I’m moving to Atlanta. I want a fresh start.

Celia: This is a surprise. I thought you were going to stick it out here and try to put the past behind you.

Nico: There are too many reminders here. I want a clean slate. What’s done is done and I’m tired of blame and recriminations.

Celia: I’m glad to hear you’ve stopped beating yourself up over what’s happened, but are you sure moving away will help you move on?

Nico: The world is my oyster now, isn’t it? I can live anywhere I want to and do anything I want to.

Celia: I guess so, but are you sure you want to uproot and leave town?

Nico: I’m not trying to reinvent myself, but if I’m going to start over, I might as well do it in a new town.

Celia: I guess a new town is a good place to start a new life, and maybe you’ll find a new love. Many people bounce back from a difficult divorce.

Nico: I’ve sworn off women. The only female I want in my life right now is my dog, Fifi!

### 1176 Limits to Advancement at Work

Gloria: Did you hear that Manuel is quitting? He took a job with another company.

Sam: I’m not surprised. He came up against the glass ceiling and he decided to jump ship.

Gloria: Really? I didn’t know he was bucking for promotion.

Sam: He’s been trying to become a manager for three years, but other people have been promoted over him or they’ve hired from outside the company.

Gloria: I didn’t know that. I was aware of the wage disparities within the company and the gender pay gap within each department, but this is news to me.

Sam: Haven’t you noticed that people who take extended leave to have children or try for some type of work-life balance are passed over for plum assignments, raises, and promotions? There are definite limits to advancement.

Gloria: I thought it was just favoritism on the part of the bosses. Their friends got promoted and other people didn’t.

Sam: That’s certainly true, but that’s only part of the story.

Gloria: Why are we still working for a company with such unfair policies?

Sam: Speak for yourself. I’m giving notice today.

### 1177 Pedestrian Safety

Rueben: I never imagined walking our daughter to school could be so dangerous.

Carla: What happened?

Rueben: We were walking on the sidewalk approaching the intersection. The crossing guard was there to stop traffic so we could cross the street. We were halfway through the designated crosswalk when a guy driving like a demon whips around the corner.

Carla: And he didn’t stop at the stop sign?

Rueben: No, he didn’t even slow down.

Carla: Didn’t he see the crossing guard or the other pedestrians?

Rueben: There are several big trees there, so it’s a blind corner with limited visibility.

Carla: Still, he should have stopped. Was anyone hurt?

Rueben: No, we were able to get out of his way, but he could have easily taken out five or six people!

Carla: That’s crazy. What we need are flashing crosswalk signs. Maybe that would get drivers’ attention.

Rueben: And maybe armor for our daughter, too?

### 1178 Using Profanity

Cameron: Oh, f***!

Dorothy: Watch your language. I don’t want the kids to hear foul language.

Cameron: Sorry, I stubbed my toe. What’s the big deal? Kids hear all kinds of cursing on TV and in movies.

Dorothy: Not my kids, at least not yet. I don’t want them learning to swear before they learn to walk. I don’t want them to grow up to be rude and offensive people.

Cameron: You can’t protect them from every damn thing people say.

Dorothy: Okay, that’s it. If you’re going to live here, we’ll need a swear jar.

Cameron: A what?!

Dorothy: A swear jar. For every swear word you say, you’ll need to put a dollar into the jar. We’ll save the money for the kids’ education.

Cameron: What the f***?!

Dorothy: Hey, there will be no profanity of any kind in this house. I don’t want you to be a bad influence on my children. Go ahead. Put a dollar into that jar.

Cameron: I’m not putting a dollar into that jar.

Dorothy: My house, my rules.

Cameron: Unbelievable!

### 1179 Reading Food Labels

Amy: Put a big bag of those potato chips in the basket.

Giorgio: Have you read the nutritional label on these chips?

Amy: No, but look. This doesn’t have very much saturated fat, trans fat, or sodium.

Giorgio: Look at the serving size. It’s three potato chips. How often do you stop at three chips?

Amy: Okay, no potato chips. I’ll get this package of cookies. There aren’t many calories or carbohydrates in these, or much cholesterol or sugar either.

Giorgio: Look again. The serving size is one cookie. There are 40 cookies in each container.

Amy: Not everything has to be healthy and good for me.

Giorgio: No, but you have to get your protein and fiber from somewhere. If you look at the percent daily value on the things you’re eating, you’re not getting the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals your body needs.

Amy: This isn’t all I eat. I eat other things, too.

Giorgio: Like pizza, hamburgers, and fries?

Amy: I might not have the best diet, but I’m healthy as a horse.

Giorgio: Maybe a horse ready to be put out to pasture!

### 1180 Price Gouging

Pedro: Why are you changing the prices on all of those items in the store?

Elisa: Haven’t you heard? There’s a hurricane coming. People will be stocking up on basic necessities.

Pedro: I know that, but that still doesn’t explain why you’ve decided to jack up prices.

Elisa: There’s nothing wrong with taking advantage of a spike in demand during emergency situations. We’re in business to make money.

Pedro: That’s price gouging and you know it. There are laws against that. And plus, we shouldn’t be exploiting people’s fear.

Elisa: I’m not responsible for that hurricane and I didn’t tell people to hoard. I’m not hiking prices so high that people can’t afford it. I’m just increasing them to discourage hoarding, that’s all.

Pedro: I don’t know. It still doesn’t feel right. It feels like we’re profiteering.

Elisa: No, we’re not. We’re making a sound business decision. Hey, where are you going with those?

Pedro: I’m putting some of these items in the back to reserve for people who can’t afford your new prices, the poorest and the most vulnerable in our community.

Elisa: You’re not suggesting we give those items away!

Pedro: You’ll thank me later for helping you to assuage your guilty conscience.

Elisa: Humph!

### 1181 Making a Comeback

Eileen: What are you doing with all that band equipment?

Dex: The guys in the band are planning a reunion. It’s time for our comeback. It will be the stuff of legends!

Eileen: Aren’t you afraid of being called has-beens after all these years?

Dex: Bite your tongue. There is a groundswell of support for this reunion and we’re not going to disappoint the fans.

Eileen: Groundswell? Are you referring to that local news article about one-hit wonders asking, “Where are they now?”

Dex: There was a lot of good response to my quote about our possible reunion. After a 20-year hiatus, I think fans are ready for more music from us. It should lead to a tour.

Eileen: Resurrecting your music career might be harder than you guys think.

Dex: Stop being such a killjoy. This reunion could lead to an entire new generation of fans.

Eileen: Or you could become the laughingstock of the music world.

Dex: Okay, that’s enough. You’re officially out of the band.

Eileen: I didn’t know I was in the band.

Dex: I had considered making you a backup singer, but I can’t deal with your negativity.

Eileen: Oh, poor me. I’ll never find stardom.

Dex: You’ve had your chance!

### 1182 Finding a Parking Space

Alan: We have to find a parking space. Let’s drive around the block one more time. Did you say that the restaurant we’re going to has no off-street parking at all?

Sasha: None. When I called the restaurant earlier today, I was told they have ample street parking.

Alan: Obviously not on a Saturday night. Look, there’s a space!

Sasha: No, look at the curb. That’s a loading zone and the area in front of it is a red zone.

Alan: This is impossible. We’ve driven along this street four times and there are no parking spaces, not even ones with meters. I’d be willing to plug the meter all evening if we could just find a space.

Sasha: I have an idea. Pull into that red zone.

Alan: Okay, but we can’t park here. What’s that?

Sasha: This is my grandfather’s handicapped placard. I borrowed it. We can park here with this.

Alan: I don’t think so. We’re going to get a parking ticket or worse, and we really shouldn’t be using your grandfather’s placard anyway.

Sasha: Do you know how many strings I had to pull to get a reservation at the hottest restaurant in town? Come on, let’s go. Why are you checking your wallet? Dinner is my treat.

Alan: I just want to make sure I have enough cash for a taxi when your car gets towed!

### 1183 Air and Water Pollution

Julia: Stop poisoning us! Stop poisoning us!

Robert: Why are you picketing in front of this factory?

Julia: This factory is polluting our air and water. They’re responsible for contaminating the environment with dangerous chemicals and waste.

Robert: But your entire family works here. Aren’t you concerned you’ll cause trouble for them and the other workers?

Julia: What’s more important is their health. The air quality in and out of this factory is at toxic levels and it’s endangering their health, not to mention what it’s doing to the ozone.

Robert: That’s terrible. Maybe I should help you picket.

Julia: Here’s a sign.

Robert: Okay, but maybe picketing is taking things a little too far.

Julia: No way! Did you know that runoff from the factory has tainted the groundwater? Did you know that workers and people in the community are breathing in dangerous particulate matter?

Robert: I didn’t know that. Do you have proof of all that?

Julia: Of course I have proof. Environmental groups have done independent tests.

Robert: Then it’s actually dangerous for me to be standing here talking to you and breathing in this toxic air.

Julia: That’s true and your willingness to help me picket is really commendable. Hey, where are you going?

### 1184 Being Boastful

My boss is a complete blowhard. He likes to boast about his accomplishments and acquisitions every chance he gets. Unfortunately, I seem to be his favorite audience.

Boss: You won’t believe what I did over the weekend. I went mountain climbing and skydiving.

What I wanted to say was, “Uh, spare me!” But what I said instead was, “Oh, really? How exciting.” It doesn’t take much encouragement to get him going.

Boss: And I found time to test-drive the new McQ sports car yesterday. I’m thinking of buying one.

Do I really look that gullible? I knew that the boss didn’t have that kind of money, but I didn’t let it show on my face and simply said, “That’s a very impressive car.”

Boss: I have my eye on a luxury vacation condo by the lake. Some lucky girl will get to stay there with me.

Now I knew he was blowing smoke, but what could I say? I just muttered, “Lucky girl,” and left it at that.

What was the point of all that, unless . . .

### 1185 Smuggling Across Borders

Christina: What is the holdup? There are cars backed up for half a mile.

Harry: I bet the Border Patrol is looking for smugglers.

Christina: Do you really think so? I wonder if there could be a drug mule in one of these cars carrying illegal drugs.

Harry: It might be drugs, but it could be any kind of contraband. I’ve heard that there’s a problem with gunrunning and other kinds of arms trafficking across these borders.

Christina: Maybe they’re looking for people trying to sneak into this country without permission.

Harry: Or they could be looking for people trying to import exotic species without permission.

Christina: What kinds of exotic species?

Harry: Plants and animals that aren’t allowed to be brought into this country, at least not without quarantine.

Christina: Plants? You mean like these herb plants I bought?

Harry: I doubt if they’re prohibited. Wait, you can’t leave the car!

Christina: What if this is contraband and they catch me with it?

Harry: They’ll confiscate it and send us on our way.

Christina: Are you sure?

Harry: Sure, I’m sure. They’d be much more interested in the bats I’m smuggling in my pants anyway.

Christina: What?!

### 1186 Being in a Severe Storm

Shana: Hey, did you hear that? There’s a severe storm coming. Let’s hope for the best.

Aecio: Yeah, I hope it doesn’t leave a lot of damage. We haven’t recovered from the aftermath of the last big storm.

Shana: No, when I said I was hoping for the best, I meant I’m hoping to catch it on film. The weather forecaster says that their radar has detected a big cyclone forming over this area.

Aecio: Let me get this straight. You’re hoping for a big storm?

Shana: Yeah, I’m a storm chaser. I’ve captured lots of tropical storms on film, and even a small tornado, but never a hurricane or typhoon.

Aecio: You mean you actually chase after storms?

Shana: Yeah, it’s fun. I hope one day to be there for a really big one and somehow get into the eye where it’s calm.

Aecio: You understand that with big storms come strong winds and floods, resulting in the destruction of homes and general chaos.

Shana: I don’t want anyone to get hurt. I’m just looking for a thrill.

Aecio: Right, just a little harmless fun!

### 1187 Visiting Churches, Mosques, and Temples

Cassius: You’ll need to cover up if you want to go in there. This is a house of worship.

Brittany: All right, if you say so. I don’t really want to go into this mosque or temple or whatever it is.

Cassius: Keep your voice down. Can’t you see that there are people at the altar in prayer?

Brittany: I’ll just stay outside. Maybe I’ll walk over to that building over there with the dome and steeple.

Cassius: That’s not a steeple. It’s a minaret, and that’s a mosque. You’re definitely not going in there dressed like that.

Brittany: Why not? I’m curious about other religions. I just want to see what it’s like inside and take lots of pictures.

Cassius: These are holy places. You can’t just barge into a house of worship to satisfy your curiosity.

Brittany: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me wanting to observe local people worshipping their gods. I’m very interested in the local culture.

Cassius: Would you like a tourist coming into your church and taking pictures of you while you’re in prayer?

Brittany: I don’t belong to a church, but if I did, I’d welcome anyone who wanted to have a look.

Cassius: Other members of your congregation might not feel that way, but do what you like. I’ll be right here ready to dust you off when they give you the boot!

### 1188 Advertising to Children

James: Look at that! It’s commercial after commercial. It’s terrible how advertisers are going after kids.

Vicky: They’re just doing their job, marketing to a lucrative demographic.

James: But just look at what our kids are bombarded with: toy commercials and junk food ads!

Vicky: Children’s television is no different from any other type of programming. Commercials are a fact of life.

James: But don’t you think it’s wrong to manipulate young viewers with these commercials? Aren’t they more susceptible to false advertising?

Vicky: Shh! That’s our company’s product commercial. It really gets your attention, doesn’t it?

James: Yeah, it’s grand, just grand.

### 1189 Sentencing a Criminal

Nancy: Hey, where have you been?

Geraldo: I’ve been in the other courtroom watching the sentencing of that murderer.

Nancy: Which murderer?

Geraldo: The one who failed to get the charges reduced through a plea agreement. During the trial, her attorneys tried to show that there were mitigating circumstances, but the judge didn’t buy it.

Nancy: Didn’t she commit two murders?

Geraldo: That’s right. The judge sentenced her to 35 years to life in prison for each crime.

Nancy: Will she serve them consecutively or concurrently?

Geraldo: She’ll be serving them consecutively, so even with time off for good behavior, she’ll be spending the next 50 years or so in prison.

Nancy: So her only hope now is an appeal, right?

Geraldo: That’s right. I’ll be following this case for a long time to come.

Nancy: And getting lots of good copy.

Geraldo: Of course. What would we crime reporters do without juicy murders?

### 1190 Dealing With Foot Problems

Walt: What are you doing?

Francesca: I’m selecting and organizing my photos for a presentation.

Walt: Oh, can I see? All of these photos are of feet!

Francesca: Well, I am a podiatrist and I’m giving a talk about foot conditions.

Walt: Ew, some of these are really disgusting!

Francesca: You’re looking at some of the most common foot conditions: blisters, corns, bunions, calluses, and athlete’s foot.

Walt: What is that?

Francesca: That’s an ingrown toenail and those are infected toenails.

Walt: I’m really glad I don’t have either one of those problems.

Francesca: You should be even happier you don’t have one of the more serious conditions such as fallen arches, a clubfoot, or arthritis in your feet.

Walt: But I do have one problem. Let me take these shoes off and show you.

Francesca: Pee-ew! I don’t even need to look at them to know you have very bad foot odor.

Walt: What should I do?

Francesca: Get some new shoes, keep them dry, and change your socks every day.

Walt: Every day? You mean I have to own more than one pair?

### 1191 Living on the Fringes of Society

Carla: Why do those teenagers have to dress like that? Don’t they want to fit in?

Donald: Maybe they feel marginalized and they’re showing their feelings of alienation through their clothes.

Carla: That’s just a bunch of psychobabble. Nobody is treating them like second-class citizens. They’re choosing to set themselves apart, to make themselves outcasts.

Donald: Maybe they don’t feel they have the same access and privileges that other people do because of social class, religious beliefs, or other factors.

Carla: Nobody is shunning them. They choose to live on the fringe of society. They need to stop making themselves conspicuous and integrate into society.

Donald: What if they doubt they’d be accepted?

Carla: That’s ridiculous.

Donald: Would you want one of them as your neighbor?

Carla: Well, I . . . well . . .

Donald: I think I’ve proved my point.

### 1192 Using a Property Management Company

Sonia: Hello, Fickle Property Management Company.

Frank: Hello, I own an office building on Broadway Boulevard and I’m interested in hiring a property management company.

Sonia: You’ve called the right place. We help you advertise your vacant units, show empty properties, and screen prospective tenants.

Frank: The building is partially occupied right now and I want to be sure that any new tenants are financially sound.

Sonia: That’s why we require a rental application with financial details and check their credit history. We are very thorough.

Frank: Will you also draw up the rental agreement?

Sonia: Yes, we handle all of the rental details, including the deposit and delivery of keys.

Frank: What if tenants have problems?

Sonia: We are on call 24/7 and will send out someone from our maintenance department to deal with any problems.

Frank: This sounds like what I’m looking for. What is your fee structure?

Sonia: Oh, our services are very reasonable.

Frank: When can you start?

Sonia: As soon as you sign an agreement with us.

Frank: Great. Can you email the agreement to me right now? The building has some stopped-up toilets that need attention ASAP!

### 1193 Reducing Food Waste

Jon: Wait! What are doing with that squishy tomato?

Marta: I’m tossing it. It’s no good anymore.

Jon: I’ll take it, and I’ll take that stale bread, too.

Marta: Stop! You can’t fish that out of the trash.

Jon: I’m trying to do my part to reduce food waste. Tired vegetables are still okay to eat, as are bruised fruit.

Marta: Fine, but not once they’ve been discarded. Stay out of my trash.

Jon: What you are going to do with this graying meat?

Marta: I was going to throw that out, too.

Jon: I’ll take it. I’m sure I can make something edible with it.

Marta: You can’t be serious. I’m all for doing my part, but I draw the line at eating spoiled meat.

Jon: It’s not spoiled. It’s just beyond the peak of freshness.

Marta: Well, be my guest. You can have all of this food.

Jon: And to show my thanks, I’ll invite you over to lunch tomorrow.

Marta: Thanks, but no thanks.

### 1194 Using a Map Program

Caroline: I just got an email from Sandra with her new address. I wish I knew what kind of neighborhood our daughter is living in.

Bryce: Let’s find out. I’ll type in her address on this map program.

Caroline: That will just tell us where she’s living within the city, not what kind of neighborhood it is.

Bryce: Just wait. I can show you the street view of her apartment and you can see what her building looks like.

Caroline: Wow, that’s amazing, but doesn’t the building look a little run-down?

Bryce: That’s what you get with high-resolution images. You see every detail. You can navigate around and see a panoramic view of her street.

Caroline: Oh, that doesn’t look very clean or safe.

Bryce: Let me show you an aerial view. The satellite view will give you a better idea of the entire area.

Caroline: Is that an airport nearby and are those factories? What will this other view show us?

Bryce: That provides real-time traffic information and allows for route planning. It looks like she lives on a highly congested street. Hey, where are you going?

Caroline: I’m going to visit our daughter. I want to see for myself what kind of hovel she’s living in!

### 1195 Types of Allergies

Bert: Doctor, give it to me straight. Is my medical condition serious?

Doctor: I suspect that your rashes and other symptoms are the result of allergies.

Bert: Allergies?! I thought I had some kind of serious disease.

Doctor: Allergies can be serious. I’m going to give you tests to see what you’re allergic to.

Bert: You mean I might have allergies to more than one thing?

Doctor: There are many kinds of allergies. Some people have food allergies and have adverse reactions when they ingest or even come near some types of food.

Bert: That sounds terrible. I hope I don’t have food allergies. I would have to restrict my diet.

Doctor: Other people have seasonal allergies to pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds.

Bert: That would mean I couldn’t do some types of outdoor activities.

Doctor: Many people are allergic to pets, most commonly cat or dog dander.

Bert: Oh no, I’d have to get rid of my three cats or dog!

Doctor: You might also be allergic to dust mites, insect bites, or even mold spores in your home.

Bert: You mean I might have to move out of my house?

Doctor: If mold is detected in your home, you might need to move out temporarily while the mold is removed.

Bert: Are you sure I don’t have some kind of disease? I think I’d prefer that to allergies!

### 1196 Checking Facts and Figures

Takagi: Before we disseminate this report, I need you to fact-check it. I don’t want a repeat of what happened last year.

Ellie: What happened last year? I wasn’t working here then.

Takagi: Last year’s report had a lot of small inaccuracies and a few major errors. We ended up having to issue a second version of the report.

Ellie: Okay, but I thought it had already been signed off on by the department heads.

Takagi: It has, but those are the same department heads who skimmed the report last year and didn’t catch all those problems. I want you to go through it with a fine-tooth comb.

Ellie: What should I check?

Takagi: Everything. I want you to verify the facts and figures and to flag anything that is outright wrong or even a little suspect.

Ellie: Okay, I’ll do that, but this will take some time.

Takagi: What are you doing this weekend?

Ellie: Nothing, now.

### 1197 Reaching a Legal Settlement

Nadia: I’m not sure about this civil lawsuit. I don’t want a long trial.

Andre: Relax. This case will never go to trial. For disputes of this kind, neither party wants to fight it out in court, so we almost always reach a settlement.

Nadia: If we do go to court, the legal fees could skyrocket. I couldn’t afford that.

Andre: If we reach a settlement, you won’t have to worry too much about that.

Nadia: All right, but what if they don’t want to admit wrongdoing?

Andre: If we reach a settlement, they don’t need to. They’ll simply pay out.

Nadia: Even if they don’t admit it, at least I’ll be able to talk freely about it.

Andre: Well, that might be a problem. Many settlements require confidentiality – from both parties.

Nadia: You mean if I settle, I can’t talk about it?

Andre: If there is a confidentiality clause, you’d be in breach of contract if you discussed the settlement.

Nadia: I didn’t know that. You mean I can’t talk about what they did to me without getting my day in court?

Andre: That’s the long and short of it.

Nadia: I guess justice is blind – but only for the rich!

### 1198 Failed Government Projects

Mariana: How long do you think it will be before the stadium is finished?

Klaus: Don’t hold your breath. The plan for the stadium is fundamentally flawed, but the government rammed it down the throats of the voters.

Mariana: Do you really think the project is doomed?

Klaus: Haven’t you heard the reports of corruption and poor management? They’re cutting corners left and right. I wouldn’t be surprised if the stadium is being built with shoddy materials.

Mariana: Then the entire thing is a joke!

Klaus: Yes, and the joke is on us. Government officials are going through the motions, not caring about the results. All they care about is lining their pockets.

Mariana: I have heard about the cost overruns. Do you think the city will ever recoup the money spent on this project?

Klaus: Maybe a little, if we can sell the entire thing as scrap metal!

### 1199 Eating on the Run

Sam: Wait a second. Is this all you’re having for lunch, this microwaved burrito?

Leticia: That’s all I have time for. It’s better than just eating it out of the package, right?

Sam: That does not look appetizing. I see indigestion in your future.

Leticia: It’s filling and that’s all I care about. I need to gulp down something before the meeting at 1:00.

Sam: Why don’t you brown bag it? Even if it’s something premade, you won’t have to rely on instant food.

Leticia: Who has the time to prepare a lunch? This burrito is actually more than I eat on most days. Normally, I munch on candy bars or bags of chips and forgo lunch altogether.

Sam: That’s not very healthy.

Leticia: No, but it keeps me going when I’m on the run on busy days like this. I have a stash in my desk. Do you want to take a look?

Sam: That collection makes fast food look like haute cuisine!

### 1200 Learning a Skilled Trade

Jeannine: What are you going to do now that you’ve graduated from high school?

Orlando: I’m going to trade school. My father was a stone and brick mason and my brother is a mechanic, but I think I’m going to try something different.

Jeannine: Like what?

Orlando: Maybe I’ll study to become an electrician or plumber. Those are skills that are always in demand.

Jeannine: Don’t they have long apprenticeships?

Orlando: Yes, but it’s better than training to be a machinist or technician. It’s easier to open your own shop as an electrician or plumber.

Jeannine: With your skills, you can always get a job as a carpenter.

Orlando: I think carpentry is a dying art. Most people don’t get furniture or other things custom-made anymore.

Jeannine: You know, you could always take a completely different path, learning a completely different skilled trade.

Orlando: Like what?

Jeannine: You could become a medical or dental technician or even get a cosmetology degree.

Orlando: Are you serious?! Would you want these hands cutting your hair?

### 1201 Types of Non-alcoholic Drinks

Asa: What can I get you to drink?

Elizabeth: I’ll have a glass of water, thanks.

Asa: Are you sure you don’t want something else? I have soft drinks, orange juice, lemonade, and fruit punch.

Elizabeth: No, thanks. I’m trying to cut back on my sugar intake.

Asa: In that case, how about an energy drink, sports drink, or bottled tea?

Elizabeth: No, really, I’m fine with water.

Asa: Ah, I bet you’d like some tea or coffee, right?

Elizabeth: No, all I want is a glass of water.

Asa: Okay, do you want tap water or bottled water, flavored water or carbonated?

Elizabeth: Do you mean to tell me you have all of those drinks in your refrigerator?

Asa: It pays to own a beverage company.

### 1202 Describing Student Achievement

Jeannie: Everything okay?

William: No, I just got off the phone with my daughter’s school and they’re not putting her in the gifted and talented program.

Jeannie: That’s disappointing, but wasn’t she struggling in school last year?

William: Her teachers were thinking of putting her in remedial classes. Can you believe that? My daughter is getting poor grades because she’s bored in school. She tunes out. She’d be coasting in her classes if the teachers would just challenge her.

Jeannie: Are you sure that’s the problem? My son was considered low-achieving in the lower grades, but since starting high school, he’s doing a lot better.

William: I’m telling you, my daughter could be high-achieving if they’d only put her in the gifted and talented program. It’s all about teacher expectations.

Jeannie: Well, it’s not all about expectations . . .

William: Are you trying to tell me that my daughter is slow and I should just accept it?

Jeannie: I’m saying that kids develop at their own pace. Some are late bloomers.

William: Nobody in my family has ever been late in anything, and they’re not going to start now.

Jeannie: Putting pressure on her might make matters worse.

William: Who’s putting pressure on her? Maybe I can help her by getting her tutors in every subject and enrolling her in summer programs.

Jeannie: Maybe she just needs more time . . .

William: And let her waste her potential? What kind of father would I be then?

### 1203 Completing a Drug/Alcohol Rehabilitation Program

John: I’m glad to see you’re back and looking so healthy.

Lindsay: Thanks. Rehab wasn’t easy, but getting treatment for my addiction saved my life. I’d hit rock bottom.

John: Recovery from substance abuse isn’t easy, but I’m happy you got the help you needed.

Lindsay: I’m glad I checked into an inpatient program. I was able to detox, and I’m now getting the medication and counseling I need.

John: I thought you were done.

Lindsay: No, I’m now in their outpatient program, with a plan for staying sober so I won’t relapse.

John: And you’re staying away from temptation?

Lindsay: Absolutely. I’m only going clubbing two nights a week, instead of every night.

John: Uh, is that wise?

Lindsay: It will be a good test of my self-control.

John: That doesn’t sound . . .

Lindsay: [sound of a car horn] Sorry, there’s my ride. We’re checking out a new club tonight.

John: Yikes.

### 1204 Controlling Information to the Media

Pablo: Okay everybody, have a seat. The purpose of this meeting is to get everybody on the same page.

I’m passing out the fact sheet we’ve prepared. This fact sheet gives a rundown on what has happened to date so that no one is in the dark about our current situation.

We’ve also prepared these talking points. This is for internal use only. I don’t want them leaked to the media. These talking points have been prepared to help everyone stay on message. Anyone talking to the media off-script will have to answer to me.

These talking points preempt many of the possible questions you’ll be asked. We hope to take the wind out of their sails by addressing some of the media’s most likely questions up front. Any questions?

Suzanna: Um, I’ve read through these talking points and I’m still not sure how to answer one key question.

Pablo: What’s that?

Suzanna: Have we solved the huge issue that’s the cause of our current problems?

Pablo: It goes without saying that if the media ever wants a straightforward answer, our response is always “no comment.”

### 1205 Bragging About Success With Women

Jonah: I’d love to get a date with Jessica. She’s so hot!

Becca: You mean you want to add another notch to your bedpost.

Jonah: I’ve been around the block, but there’s nothing wrong with sowing a few wild oats. That’s all part of being young and carefree.

Becca: Hmm, maybe you shouldn’t be telling me about your conquests.

Jonah: Why not? It’s no secret that I’ve got game. Chicks dig me. Last week alone I . . .

Becca: Really, I think I’ll take a pass on the play-by-play.

Jonah: See that woman over there? Watch me put the moves on her.

Becca: No, thanks. I’m leaving.

Jonah: Wait! Are you going to put in a good word for me with Jessica?

Becca: You know that she’s a good friend of mine, right?

Jonah: Of course I do. That’s why I’m asking you.

Becca: And you thought I’d set her up with a player?

Jonah: I thought she might like a man with experience.

Becca: Forget it.

Jonah: In that case, what are you doing Saturday?

[door slams]

### 1206 Outdoor Vacation Sports and Activities

Emma: Are you ready?

Ricardo: Sure, but why are you dressed like that? I thought we were going to play golf with Kareem and Karen.

Emma: I told them we’re going rock climbing instead.

Ricardo: I was really looking forward to a game of golf.

Emma: You play golf all the time. How often do you get the chance to do other outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and zip-lining. We can do both this afternoon if you’re up for it.

Ricardo: I thought the point of this vacation was to rest and recharge.

Emma: We do need to recharge, but what we need is excitement, not rest. Maybe Kareem and Karen will want to join us tomorrow.

Ricardo: Why? What are we doing tomorrow?

Emma: How about a watersport, maybe kayaking, windsurfing, or water skiing? Too bad we can’t go scuba diving, but we can do some snorkeling.

Ricardo: I like the idea of spending some time on the water, but whale watching is more my speed.

Emma: Don’t you want to feel the wind through your hair and the excitement pumping through your veins?

Ricardo: I didn’t know you were such an adrenaline junkie.

Emma: Guilty as charged. I’m going to take skydiving lessons next month. Want to join me?

Ricardo: I consider skydiving a spectator sport!

### 1207 Gauging the Doneness of Meat

Chris: How do you like your steak?

Ruth: Well done. I don’t like any pink showing and I don’t mind if it’s a little charred.

Chris: I’ll cook it the way you want it, but it’ll be dry and tough.

Ruth: Yes, but a longer cooking time kills foodborne illnesses. I don’t want to eat anything that’s undercooked.

Chris: It doesn’t have to be burnt to be safe to eat. It’s easy to gauge when meat is done. How about if I brown each side to seal in the juices and then cook it to medium doneness?

Ruth: No, I don’t want to take any chances. I’d rather the steak is overcooked than undercooked. Are you going to eat that?

Chris: Yes, I like my steak juicy.

Ruth: But that’s raw!

Chris: No, it’s cooked rare, not raw. I’ll cut into it so you can see that it’s cooked.

Ruth: It’s oozing red! That is definitely not cooked.

Chris: I’ll prove it to you. I’ll eat this piece and live to tell about it.

Ruth: Don’t put that in your mouth! You’re risking your health.

Chris: I think I’ll survive.

### 1208 Living on Low Wages

Dylan: Here.

Yvonne: What’s this?

Dylan: It’s information about a job-training program. It’ll give you the skills you need to get steady work.

Yvonne: I don’t need that. I get by with the wages I earn from this job.

Dylan: You’re in a dead-end job straining to make ends meet every month.

Yvonne: I’ve always landed on my feet.

Dylan: But you don’t have any job security. You could be out on your ear any minute. Don’t you want a better quality of life?

Yvonne: My life is fine the way it is. I may not be able to hold on to this job for long, but there will always be other ones.

Dylan: I wish I had your optimism. To hear you speak, you’d think you were one of the privileged few.

Yvonne: It’s all in your outlook on life. I don’t have mortgages to pay, cars to maintain, jets to fuel, and employees to support.

Dylan: You’re right. You should be counting your blessings!

### 1209 Questioning Mental Competency

Claire: What are you doing with all those law books? I thought you retired 20 years ago.

Ray: I’m preparing for my mental competency hearing.

Claire: Mental competency hearing? But your mind is as sharp as it has ever been.

Ray: That’s not what my children think. They are going to court to prove my diminished capacity. They are going to argue that I need a conservator for my estate.

Claire: Nobody who knows you would question your sound mind. There must be another reason for this hearing.

Ray: You’re right. My children want to get their hands on my money, and if they can prove mental incapacitation and impaired judgment, they will get power of attorney.

Claire: And if they get power of attorney . . .

Ray: They would get control of my company and my entire estate.

Claire: So what are you going to do?

Ray: I am going to fight fire with fire. I’m suing them.

Claire: What for?

Ray: Fraud, and I can make it stick. They’re both lacking in common sense. Everybody knows you should never sue an attorney, especially a successful one!

### 1210 Small Town Charm

Alisha: Hey, you’re back from your vacation. Where did you go? New York City? Miami?

Ramon: I decided to spend my vacation in Maddieville.

Alisha: Where is Maddieville? I’ve never heard of it.

Ramon: It’s a small town about a six-hour drive from here. I read about it being a throwback to the days of small shops and friendly neighbors, with a charming old-fashioned main street. It was really nice.

Alisha: I’m not sure I’d want to travel back in time. It doesn’t sound very exciting.

Ramon: It wasn’t as lively as some places I could have gone, but I enjoyed the quaint shops, the unpretentious people, and the genuine friendliness.

Alisha: What did you do for an entire week?

Ramon: I perused the shops, ate at the family-owned restaurants, and learned about the quirky history of the town by shooting the breeze with the old-timers at the local bar.

Alisha: To each his own, but that sounds like dullsville to me.

Ramon: Then I guess you wouldn’t want to go back with me this summer for their wine festival.

Alisha: Did you say wine? Maybe I shouldn’t dismiss small town charm quite so quickly.

### 1211 Watching Movie and TV Franchises

Ursula: Weren’t you watching this same movie yesterday?

Ian: No, this is the sequel. Yesterday, I watched Aims Pond. This is Aims Pond: Super Spy.

Ursula: Wasn’t this originally a TV show?

Ian: Actually, it was originally a novel, which was adapted into a long-running TV show. Then, it was turned into a movie franchise. The new installment is coming out next month and I can’t wait!

Ursula: The latest installment? I thought it was just a trilogy.

Ian: No, the original film has spawned four sequels and two prequels so far.

Ursula: So you’re watching all the films again?

Ian: That’s right, but I’m not stopping there. I’m watching all of the TV show episodes again, too. And if I have time, I’ll even watch the spin-off.

Ursula: Spin-off? I didn’t know there had been a spin-off.

Ian: There was. Aims Pond’s brother got his own show: Jaime Pond: Building Inspector. It wasn’t very successful.

Ursula: I guess we can call you a superfan.

Ian: That’s right. I’m a superfan of the super spy!

### 1212 Providing Tech Support

Max: Hello, hello, is this call-in tech support?

Grace: Yes, my name is Grace and this is the help desk. How can I help you today?

Max: I’m having a problem with my machine and I don’t know what to do.

Grace: Have you tried reading our online troubleshooting guide or asking your question on the support forum?

Max: The what?

Grace: Never mind. Can you describe the problem you’re having?

Max: It doesn’t work.

Grace: I understand that. What exactly is the malfunction?

Max: It’s not working.

Grace: For me to diagnose whether it’s a software or hardware problem, I’ll need more information. Unfortunately, I can’t repair it remotely.

Max: Okay, I understand.

Grace: Good. We offer all kinds of support, from setup to customization to disaster recovery, but I can’t do anything if I don’t understand the problem.

Max: Okay.

Grace: Could you walk me through what happens when you turn on the machine?

Max: Nothing.

Grace: Nothing? Nothing at all?

Max: Zip, zilch, zero.

Grace: Sir, is the machine plugged in?

Max: Oh, it needs to be plugged in?

### 1213 Using Different Payment Systems

Petra: Damn! That didn’t work either.

Ken: What are you doing?

Petra: I’m trying to pay for a new service I ordered, but the website won’t accept my credit card as payment. I even tried my debit card, but it’s been rejected, too.

Ken: Why don’t you just write a check and mail it in?

Petra: I don’t have any checks. In this day and age, I should be able to use one of the many electronic funds transfer options.

Ken: What are going to do now?

Petra: I might try sending a wire, but my bank charges a large fee for wires.

Ken: How about signing up for direct deposit?

Petra: If this were an ongoing service I would, but this is a one-time thing. Do you think I could try your credit card?

Ken: I don’t know about that . . .

Petra: All right, if you feel funny about doing that then could you buy me a gift card for this website and then I can turn around and use the balance?

Ken: That seems kind of involved. Would you pay me back in cash?

Petra: Of course. I will write you an IOU right now and then go to the bank tomorrow.

Ken: How about if you go to the bank now. I’ll even give you a ride.

Petra: Is that really necessary? We don’t even know if it’s going to work.

Ken: When it comes to money, I always say “better safe than sorry.”

### 1214 Experiencing Dread

Brianna: Are you still here? I thought you left ages ago.

Viktor: There’s no rush. I’m thinking of postponing until tomorrow.

Brianna: Why?

Viktor: I feel a sense of foreboding. I have a sneaking suspicion that things aren’t going to go well.

Brianna: Under the circumstances, I can understand your reluctance, but it’s like ripping off a bandage. It’s best done quickly.

Viktor: I’m not sure about that. I have a feeling that things are going to go very, very wrong, and the longer I can put it off the better.

Brianna: Next week is your girlfriend’s birthday. You don’t want to break up with her on her birthday, do you?

Viktor: No, that would be cruel. Maybe I should hold off until after next week.

Brianna: You’re really dreading breaking up with her, aren’t you?

Viktor: She’s got a temper. When I told her that I couldn’t join her on a visit to her parents’ house last weekend, she went ballistic, and I have dents in my car door to show for it. I expect this to be much, much worse.

Brianna: Ah, I see. I never liked the idea of breaking up with someone remotely, but it might be called for in this case.

### 1215 A Fear of Heights

Christine: Help me! I’m going to fall!

Asahi: You’re not going to fall. I’ve got you.

Christine: Sorry, I have a fear of heights. I sometimes have panic attacks when I’m high up off the ground.

Asahi: Okay, but we’re not very high up.

Christine: I know. My phobia is totally irrational.

Asahi: That explains a lot, like why you live on the ground floor of your apartment building and why you didn’t want to go hiking near the cliffs.

Christine: That’s right. I try to avoid any situations that will trigger my fear.

Asahi: So how do you travel? Do you ever fly?

Christine: The one time I flew in an airplane I experienced vertigo and I hyperventilated until we landed. I was really agitated because I thought I was going to die. It wasn’t pretty. That’s why I normally drive or take a train.

Asahi: So I’m guessing no skydiving for you.

Christine: Not unless you want to find out how my stomach reacts to heights!

### 1216 Working in a Job You Love

Lorna: It’s great to be alive, isn’t it?

Deangelo: What are you so happy about?

Lorna: I’m just happy to come to work.

Deangelo: What?!

Lorna: I’ve come to realize that this is more than a job. It’s a vocation. I’m doing valuable work that I’m well suited for.

Deangelo: Are you on something?

Lorna: I’m high on life and my newfound sense of purpose. I realize that I’m doing this job because I have a calling and this is what I’m meant to do.

Deangelo: I’m serious. Are you coming down with something?

Lorna: Of course not. Yesterday, it occurred to me the legacy I’ll be leaving behind after my life’s work is done.

Deangelo: Life’s work?

Lorna: Yes, I’ll be remembered in posterity as someone who made a difference.

Deangelo: You do remember what you do for a living, right?

Lorna: I provide salve to people who need it. I give succor to those in need.

Deangelo: You serve drinks in a bar.

Lorna: I provide a shoulder to cry on, a calm voice in a crazy world.

Deangelo: Talk about delusions of grandeur!

### 1217 Fighting the Effects and Signs of Aging

Xavier: What crazy new creams are you trying this week?

Aaliyah: I’ll have you know I only use anti-aging products that are scientifically proven.

Xavier: Yeah, like that cream that promised to restore your youthful appearance in just two weeks. When are you going to realize beauty products are sold using false claims and promises?

Aaliyah: What about you? You jump on the bandwagon of every health fad. Aren’t you eating a bunch of so-called superfoods?

Xavier: That’s based on science. The goal is longevity.

Aaliyah: And this expensive new computer program?

Xavier: It’s to ward off dementia and Alzheimer’s. I’m keeping my mind active.

Aaliyah: So we’re both trying to fight the effects of aging.

Xavier: I guess that’s true, but I’m going to outlive you.

Aaliyah: Yes, but before I kick the bucket, I’m going to look marvelous!

### 1218 Describing Relative Location

Penelope: Tell me about the new town you’re moving to.

Outis: It’s called Nusquam and it’s smack dab in the middle of the country.

Penelope: Where is it exactly?

Outis: I can’t give you the coordinates, if that’s what you’re after.

Penelope: Of course not. I’m just trying to pinpoint where it is. Is it near Wichita, Kansas?

Outis: It’s nowhere near Wichita. It’s in the heart of a remote part of the country.

Penelope: Where is it relative to, this town?

Outis: I can’t give you any reference points or tell you the distance. I’ll just say it’s on the outskirts of a medium-sized town and borders Nebraska.

Penelope: Why are you being so cryptic?

Outis: I’ll tell you that when you spill the beans on why you’re asking.

Penelope: I thought I’d come for an extended stay to help you get settled.

Outis: You’ve just answered your own question.

### 1219 Expressing Disapproval

Lucinda: Maggie and Gerry are moving in together. They want to start a family.

Thomas: I don’t approve of that. They’re not married and it’s a disgrace. Shame on them!

Lucinda: I understand your objections, but they love each other and need our support, not our condemnation.

Thomas: If I were their parents, I’d give them an earful. Someone should take them to task for making such irresponsible decisions.

Lucinda: They know what they’re doing and it’s not our place to criticize their decision.

Thomas: But I don’t have to like it. I’m not sending them a housewarming gift, that’s for sure.

Lucinda: Too late. I sent one and signed both our names.

Thomas: You did what?! How will they know I disapprove of what they’re doing when you go behind my back and do that?

Lucinda: I think your reproach will come through loud and clear.

### 1220 Ramping Up Production

Kareem: Have you seen the latest sales figures? We need to ramp up production right now.

Valerie: We don’t know if that increase is simply a blip or a trend.

Kareem: Those sales figures are significantly above projected levels. Our product is in demand and we need to meet that demand with a larger production run.

Valerie: But that would mean a big increase in capital outlay.

Kareem: We have to spend money to make money. We don’t want to be caught short if sales continue like this.

Valerie: But if they don’t, we’d be saddled with a huge surplus in inventory.

Kareem: When we rolled out this new product, we hoped it would catch on and it has. Are we going to sit on our hands and do nothing?

Valerie: I guess you’re right. Should we increase production by 10 percent?

Kareem: Ten percent? We’re doubling production.

Valerie: Doubling production?! Are you crazy?

Kareem: Crazy like a fox.

### 1221 Buffing Up Home Security

Martin: Why do you look so upset?

Joselyn: Our neighbor’s house was broken into last night. The burglar stole her laptop and some jewelry. Like us, she doesn’t have a security system.

Martin: Burglar alarms aren’t foolproof. Well, I’m not letting any burglars get close to our house. Let’s go.

Joselyn: Where are we going?

Martin: To the home improvement store. We need to buff up our security. I want to install motion detectors, floodlights, and security cameras to the outside of the house.

Joselyn: I suppose that’s a good idea.

Martin: I also want to put a timer on our indoor lights and a better deadbolt for the front door.

Joselyn: Those will probably help.

Martin: We can find out the cost of metal bars for the windows and a security door.

Joselyn: Whoa, I think that might be a bit much.

Martin: Nonsense. If we’re going to do something, we’re going to do it right. Barbed wire on top of our fence would probably be next . . .

Joselyn: That’s not a good idea . . .

Martin: And last but not least, we’ll need an attack dog.

Joselyn: An attack dog?! This is sounding more like a military compound than a home.

Martin: That’s right. When I’m done, Fort Knox will have nothing on us!

### 1222 Describing Amounts and Movement of Liquid

Jerry: Want to help me wash my car?

Helen: I guess so.

Jerry: Good. Squirt a little of this cleaning fluid into this bucket.

Helen: Okay, done.

Jerry: Then pour a capful of this into the bucket and mix. After that, dribble three drops of this special liquid into it and stir until you get a nice layer of foam on the surface.

Helen: Okay, but I usually just use soap and water.

Jerry: That might be fine for your car, but for my baby, it’s nothing but the best. Stop!

Helen: Why? I was just going to use this hose to spray water onto the car to get it wet.

Jerry: You can’t just splash water on the paint. You have to let it flow gently down from the roof of the car in a cascade.

Helen: You’re kidding, right?

Jerry: Not at all. Splattering water on the paint could damage it in the long run. Let the water gush out of the hose and onto the roof of the car. Let it caress the car like you’re . . .

Helen: You know what? I think this is getting a little weird. I think I’ll leave you and your baby alone.

### 1223 Experiencing a Difficult Childhood

Morris: Congratulations on finishing your latest book. What’s it about?

Toni: It’s about a girl whose parents abandoned her at birth and who ends up living on the streets. She experiences abuse and is put in juvie.

Morris: Wow, that sounds heavy. Wasn’t your last book about children whose parents served time in prison and who lived in fear of bullies in their neighborhood?

Toni: Yes, I wrote that after my first book, which was about a brother and sister who lived in an impoverished home, traumatized by events beyond their control.

Morris: Do you ever write about happy childhoods?

Toni: I do write about happy childhoods. All of the children and teenagers in my books are very resilient. They are survivors.

Morris: I was thinking about children who have normal childhoods with two parents living in the suburbs.

Toni: You call that normal? You think they’d be happy? I bet there’s an underbelly of crime and misery in most seemingly perfect families.

Morris: I’ve no doubt that if that were true, you’d be the one to write about it.

### 1224 Setting Timers and Alarms

Laquisha: What’s in the bag?

Yun: Three alarm clocks and a kitchen timer.

Laquisha: What are they for?

Yun: I have a very important interview tomorrow morning and these will help me prepare for it.

Laquisha: How?

Yun: The timer will help me time my responses to common interview questions so I don’t run off at the mouth. See? Instead of the stopwatch function, I use the countdown function so I’ll know when to wrap up.

Laquisha: And the alarm clocks?

Yun: I have a habit of pressing the snooze button after an alarm goes off. I’ve tried different kinds of alarms: ones that buzz, ones that beep, ones that vibrate, and ones that use a ringtone. But I still fall back to sleep.

Laquisha: And what do you plan to do with three alarm clocks?

Yun: I plan to set the alarms one minute apart and put them around my bedroom. By the time I turn them all off, I should be awake.

Laquisha: And if not?

Yun: Then maybe I should be applying for jobs as a mattress tester.

### 1225 Being a Good Samaritan

Ana Maria: Did you see this news article about the Good Samaritan who stopped to help a stranger and died?

Gio: That’s his own fault. Who told him to meddle in other people’s business?

Ana Maria: He wasn’t meddling. He saw that a fellow human being was in distress and was selfless enough to try to help.

Gio: Doing a good deed, was he? Going out on a limb to help someone in need, eh?

Ana Maria: Exactly. I call him a hero.

Gio: I call him a fool. You don’t put yourself in danger to help a stranger. That’s just common sense.

Ana Maria: So you would have just walked right by and done nothing to help.

Gio: If it meant putting myself in jeopardy. You should always look out for yourself, no matter what the situation.

Ana Maria: Great, remind me never to get into a lifeboat with you!

### 1226 Describing Sounds

Naomi: Stop! Stop!

Omar: What’s the matter?

Naomi: My bike is making a strange sound.

Omar: What kind of sound?

Naomi: It’s a clanging sound followed by a hissing or buzzing noise. I need to pinpoint where it’s coming from.

Omar: Walk your bike and we’ll both listen, you on one side and me on the other.

Naomi: Okay, here goes. Hear that?

Omar: Yeah, but it’s more of a popping or pinging sound.

Naomi: It sounded different when I was riding it. I’ll get on and you run alongside. What do you hear?

Omar: I hear the whirring of the pedals and the creaking and rattling of the chain, but no clanging sound.

Naomi: I’ll speed up. What do you hear now?

Omar: Nothing, just the rustling of my own clothes.

Naomi: The sound gets louder as I speed up. I’ll go faster. Now what do you hear?

Omar: Just my own panting and . . . my . . . last gasp . . .

### 1227 Altering Clothing

Mom: Put on these pants and this shirt, come over here, and stand still. I need to alter your brother’s clothes to fit you.

Sa’ad: Oh, Mom!

Mom: Hurry up. I need to let down the hems and take up the sleeves. I don’t think I have to take in the pant legs, but I might have to let out the waist a little.

Sa’ad: Ouch!

Mom: Sorry, but you need to stop moving around or your hem will be uneven and your seams will be crooked. You and your brothers are growing so fast I feel like a full-time tailor!

Sa’ad: Are we done?

Mom: No, we’re not. Stay right there. You can help me iron a crease into this shirt before I put it through the sewing machine.

Sa’ad: Oh, Mom!

Mom: Don’t “Oh, Mom” me. This machine doesn’t seem to be working. I hope I don’t have to stitch all these by hand.

Sa’ad: Mom, since I’m growing so fast, I’ll probably grow out of these clothes in a couple of months. Let’s wait until after my growth spurt to alter them.

Mom: And what will you wear in the meantime, high waters?

Sa’ad: No, shorts!

### 1228 Designing a Product Line

Thomas: What do you think of my creations?

Celeste: These are . . . interesting?

Thomas: They’re part of my new product line to be sold under my own label.

Celeste: Really?

Thomas: Yeah, I’m jumping in with both feet. Everybody advised me to get my feet wet by licensing a collection, but I don’t want to sell under someone else’s brand.

Celeste: I thought you started all this by doing custom work.

Thomas: I did, but I’m ready to produce an entire line I’ve designed according to my vision, not work to a client’s specs.

Celeste: I can understand that. Will you be selling to trade or retail customers?

Thomas: Retail. I plan to have showrooms in every major city. See? This is a sample of our product catalog.

Celeste: I see. Your products look high-end, but they’re intended for the mass market.

Thomas: That’s right. Do you want to take home a sample?

Celeste: Um, I guess so. I’d never considered using anything like that.

Thomas: Once you sit on a designer toilet seat, you’ll never go back!

### 1229 Telling Others to Go Away

Joshua: Beat it and don’t come back!

Rosa: What’s all the noise?

Joshua: It’s the neighborhood kids. All I want to do on this sunny afternoon is sit out on the porch and enjoy the day. But those neighborhood kids keep coming around and making all kinds of noise. Hey you, shoo!

Rosa: They’re just trying to get a rise out of you. Maybe if you ignore them and stop waving them off and telling them to run along, they’ll go away on their own.

Joshua: If I don’t tell them to get lost, they’ll sit here in front of my house and clown around. They’ll make so much noise it’ll wreck my peace and quiet. Hey, I see you. Take a hike!

Rosa: I think I know what to do to get you that peace and quiet. I’ll be right back.

Joshua: Where are you going?

Rosa: I’m going to get a plate of cookies for those kids.

Joshua: Are you crazy? Are you rewarding those rowdy troublemakers with cookies?!

Rosa: It’s a bribe and it always works.

### 1230 Expressing Disapproval of Elected Officials

Hilary: Which candidate are you going to vote for in the upcoming election?

Donald: Neither one. I’m not voting.

Hilary: What? You have to vote. Don’t you want to make your voice heard?

Donald: Neither candidate represents my views. They each have their own political agendas that reflect the concerns of the elite, not people like you and me.

Hilary: To me, voter apathy is the real problem. Things won’t change if we don’t vote.

Donald: You’re not listening. Both candidates are in the pockets of special interest groups and only care about pork-barrel politics. They’re not really concerned about the everyday challenges that you and I face.

Hilary: That’s not true. Look at the platforms of each candidate. They each stand for different things.

Donald: That’s just lip service. They’ll say whatever matches public opinion to get elected. No matter who gets into office, things will stay the same for regular folks like you and me.

Hilary: So you’re really not going to vote?

Donald: Nope.

Hilary: What do you hope to achieve?

Donald: Consider it a silent protest by the disaffected.

### 1231 Feeding a Large Family on a Small Budget

Paresh: Are you shopping for an army?

Sandy: Oh hi, Paresh. No, my three nephews have come to live with me. I’m not sure how I’m going to feed them on a tight budget.

Paresh: My mother was a master at making a little go a long way. There are seven kids in my family.

Sandy: What did she do?

Paresh: She only bought fruits and vegetables that were in season and generic or store brands.

Sandy: I’m trying to do that and also buying only staples.

Paresh: My mother also bought in bulk and stocked up when things were on sale.

Sandy: I’ll need to start doing that.

Paresh: She was also able spend less by using some time-tested recipes. She planned meals for an entire week and each ingredient did double duty. Nothing went to waste.

Sandy: That sounds like a good plan.

Paresh: My mom also never turned her nose up at day-old bread or marked-down food. She was amazing and she made it work.

Sandy: I need to take a cue from your mother. I love those boys but they’re going to eat me out of house and home!

### 1232 Intimidating a Coworker

Larry: How’s it going? You having fun?

Anat: You know full well that this is out of my area of expertise, but I’m coping.

Larry: Is that what you’re doing? It looks to me like you’re making a mess of things.

Anat: Cut me some slack. I’ve only been working on this for a day and it’ll take me a little time to get up to speed.

Larry: You know what I think?

Anat: No and I don’t care.

Larry: I think you’re in over your head. Why don’t you step aside and let someone competent do the job.

Anat: No amount of heckling or trash talking will make me quit. I’m here for the long haul.

Larry: We’ll see about that. People more qualified than you are have packed it in after they got a taste of how things are done around here.

Anat: Talk all you like, but no amount of intimidation will get you what you want.

Larry: And you know what I want?

Anat: I think so. You’d like me to go away with my tail between my legs, but it’ll be a cold day in hell before that happens.

### 1233 Improving Flexibility and Mobility

Rashida: Hi, I’m Rashida and I’m your physical therapist. I’m here to help you regain flexibility and mobility after your accident.

Phil: I’m really not sure I need a physical therapist. I can move around pretty well right now.

Rashida: Aren’t you feeling stiffness in your arms and tightness in your shoulders?

Phil: Not really.

Rashida: Try lifting your arms over your head.

Phil: See? I’m fine.

Rashida: You can’t lift them above your shoulders. I can help you improve your range of motion. Now let’s check out your hips and legs.

Phil: There’s nothing wrong with my hips and legs!

Rashida: Can you bend at the waist and touch your toes? Are you able to squat?

Phil: I probably could if I stretched and limbered up.

Rashida: I think you need more than stretching. I’ll work you through some exercises that will strengthen your muscles and loosen scar tissue. You’ll be able to move more freely. Don’t you want that?

Phil: W . . . W . . . Will it hurt?

Rashida: Only a little. Let’s get started.

Phil: Ow, ow, ow!

Rashida: We haven’t started yet.

### 1234 Traveling With Pets

Amin: I can’t stand to be away from Fifi for two weeks. Can’t we bring her along?

Eva: We’ve talked about this before. Our dog does not like to travel. We’ll board her.

Amin: What if we get a really big crate or carrier that Fifi will feel comfortable in?

Eva: It won’t make a difference if she’s left out on a hot tarmac and has to spend hours in cargo hold.

Amin: It’ll be well ventilated and the crate will be large enough for her to turn around in.

Eva: She’ll still bark and whimper and you know it. Do you want her to suffer?

Amin: Of course not. What if she can travel in the cabin with us?

Eva: She’s too big.

Amin: We could change our travel plans, drive instead of fly.

Eva: We’re not changing our travel plans. She’ll be fine at the kennel.

Amin: She’ll have separation anxiety.

Eva: Are you talking about the dog or about you?

### 1235 Joining a Secret Society

Nathan: Can you keep a secret?

Mia: Sure.

Nathan: I’ve been initiated into a secret society at school. I’m one of the chosen few.

Mia: Is it supposed to be a big deal?

Nathan: Of course it is. It’s very exclusive. Not many people are invited to join.

Mia: But what’s the purpose of this secret society?

Nathan: Well, we have a secret handshake and we have some really mysterious rites and rituals.

Mia: What kinds of rites and rituals?

Nathan: I can’t tell you. I’ve been sworn to secrecy.

Mia: But what is the purpose of the society? Do you have some goal to accomplish, some reason for existence?

Nathan: The point is that the members are bound by an allegiance to each other and to the society.

Mia: You mean like you’d take a bullet for each other?

Nathan: Well, no.

Mia: Or protect each other at all costs, even by lying and cheating?

Nathan: No, at least I wouldn’t.

Mia: Then what does it all amount to?

Nathan: If anyone asks us about it, we deny its existence. We have a secret that no one else knows.

Mia: Not anymore.

### 1236 Dressing Inappropriately for Work

Thierry: I know it’s casual Friday, but some people just don’t know how to dress appropriately for work.

Olga: I was thinking the same thing. Look at Sandy. What she’s wearing is far too revealing.

Thierry: I was actually thinking about Jimmy. He’s wearing cutoffs and flip-flops. Where is his professionalism?

Olga: Don’t they know how they’re dressed can affect their careers? Some people can’t see past poor fashion choices.

Thierry: Yeah, so many people are closed-minded and think what people wear reflects their ability.

Olga: I’ve known a lot of people like that. Me? I always err on the side of caution.

Thierry: Is that why you never dress down?

Olga: That’s right. And I’ve noticed you don’t either.

Thierry: No, just because we suspend the dress code one day a week doesn’t mean we have to dress inappropriately.

Olga: True, though both Sandy and Jimmy look really comfortable.

Thierry: Yeah, they do. It must be nice to walk around the office without dress shoes. Maybe, just once, I’ll come to work in shorts next week.

Olga: What?! After everything you’ve said?

Thierry: I was thinking of tasteful shorts, nothing tacky.

Olga: Just remember that it’s a slippery slope, my friend. I hope to never see you here in a tank top!

### 1237 Disagreements About Spending Money

Ezra: Wait a minute. What happened to the $500 in our joint account?

Charlotte: I probably paid bills with it. You know that our paychecks barely cover our monthly expenses.

Ezra: I know, but I was counting on that $500 to pay for new tires for my car.

Charlotte: Do you really need new tires right now? The way I look at it, if there’s any balance in our account, I have dibs on it for some new shoes.

Ezra: Forget it. The tires are a necessity and your shoes are not. We’re each supposed to have $150 a month for discretionary spending for nonessentials, and new shoes definitely falls into that category.

Charlotte: You don’t need to spend $500 for a set of new tires. You just want to splash the cash for some fancy ones.

Ezra: Let’s stop arguing about who gets to spend the money and first figure out what happened to it. According to this, the money was withdrawn from our account for automatic contributions to our retirement accounts.

Charlotte: Our what?

Ezra: Our retirement accounts. Remember last month we decided to start saving money for retirement?

Charlotte: Whose harebrained idea was that? Do you think we can get the money back?

Ezra: I’m not sure, but if we can, I have dibs!

### 1238 Making Accusations

Pierre: What happened here?!

Marie: It looks like somebody trashed your experiment.

Pierre: It’s ruined, completely ruined.

Marie: Who could have done this? Why are you looking at me like that?

Pierre: Very few people have access to this lab and even fewer know which of these experiments is mine. Whoever did this knew how to do maximum damage.

Marie: And you’re accusing me? I helped you with that experiment. I’d sooner ruin my own work than intentionally damage someone else’s, much less yours. What would be my motive?

Pierre: Maybe you gave me a little too much help and now my work is outshining yours.

Marie: Your suspicions are completely unfounded. I’ve never been jealous of any attention you’ve received. You’re totally off base.

Pierre: Maybe you’re right. I’m sorry. I just can’t believe what’s happened.

Marie: I’d be upset, too, but let’s not do any more finger-pointing. We need more information before we accuse or exonerate anyone. Let’s try to stay calm.

Pierre: Yes, of course, you’re right. Hey, what happened to your workspace? It looks like it’s been tampered with.

Marie: What?! I’ll kill whoever did this! I’ll kill them!

### 1239 Sharing an Online Account

Sara: Hello, customer service. How may I help you today?

Gabriel: Hello. I noticed some suspicious activity on my account and I want to find out if there’s been unauthorized access.

Sara: Let’s take a look. Your account history shows purchases nearly every day beginning two weeks ago.

Gabriel: That’s the problem. I haven’t made any purchases.

Sara: Do you have a shared account, by any chance?

Gabriel: Yes, I have a household account that’s shared by my entire family. My wife has full access, but my children only have restricted access.

Sara: I’m afraid that’s not showing in your account preferences. Both of your children have full access.

Gabriel: Even so, they know not to abuse their privileges. They wouldn’t buy things without asking my wife or me first.

Sara: Are you sure, sir? I show that both of your children have accessed the account regularly. In fact, they’re both logged on right now.

Gabriel: They are? What are they doing?

Sara: They’re in the process of buying several more items and are checking out.

Gabriel: Stop them! This is an emergency. Shut down my account.

Sara: I’m not sure I can do that, sir. Perhaps you can stop them on your end.

Gabriel: I’ll stop them all right. Just wait till I get my hands on those two!

### 1240 Giving Correct Change

Evelyn: If you want a job here as a cashier, you’ll need to be able to give correct change.

Hank: Don’t you use a cash register here?

Evelyn: We do, but when it’s not working, we have to be able to calculate change in our heads in a pinch.

Hank: Oh, I didn’t realize that.

Evelyn: Okay, let’s see how you do with a simple sale. Let’s say I’m purchasing these two items and I’m paying with a $20 bill.

Hank: All right, give me a minute . . . the total is $9.36.

Evelyn: Make sure you count back the change.

Hank: I’ve never done that before. I’m not sure I know how.

Evelyn: Count up starting with the coins and working your way up to the paper money. Count out loud so the customer gets a running total.

Hank: Okay, but first I have to do the math. The change should be . . . Can I have a piece of paper to check my work? I don’t want to short the customer or give them too much change.

Evelyn: You won’t have time to do that with each customer. Math wasn’t your favorite subject in school, was it?

Hank: You’re right about that. Maybe I need to work on my math skills. In the meantime, I’m handy with a mop.

Evelyn: Good to hear. There’s a cleanup on aisle three that’s got your name all over it.

### 1241 Breaking an Arm or a Leg

Elizabeth: We need to get you to the hospital right now!

Sidney: I took a tumble, that’s all. It’s nothing – just a little pain in my elbow and leg.

Elizabeth: Your arm is twisted in an odd angle and you’re limping. You could have broken bones.

Sidney: In the past, I’ve had a compound fracture in my ankle and a stress fracture in my wrist, and they both hurt a lot more than this. I’m sure it’s nothing serious.

Elizabeth: Look how your arm is swelling up. It almost looks deformed. And you still can’t put weight on your leg.

Sidney: The last thing I need right now is to get a splint or a cast. I have to get to work.

Elizabeth: You can’t work in the shape you’re in. Why don’t you let me take you to the emergency room to get treated?

Sidney: I’ll just take a couple of painkillers and walk it off.

Elizabeth: You mean limp it off. Well, in the end, it’s your arm, it’s your leg, and it’s your funeral!

### 1242 Having Difficulty Reaching a Group Decision

Derrick: That does it. I give up!

Liz: Don’t lose heart. We’ll come to a consensus sooner or later.

Derrick: No, we won’t. We’re hopelessly deadlocked.

Liz: It’s true we’re evenly split right now, but we only need one person to change their mind to break the tie.

Derrick: The trouble is, everybody seems to have made up their minds and they’re beginning to dig in their heels.

Liz: Before they do, let’s take one more vote. Maybe somebody has changed their mind.

Derrick: I doubt it. Nobody wants to be outvoted so both sides are trying to maintain the status quo. They’d rather be deadlocked than on the losing side.

Liz: But if we don’t reach an agreement, we’ll have to come back tomorrow and continue our discussions and deliberations.

Derrick: You’re right! I can’t spend another day in this room. I’ve held out long enough.

Liz: What do you mean?

Derrick: The only way I’m getting out of here is to change sides!

### 1243 Getting an Anesthetic

Nurse: I’m here to prep you for your procedure. Did the doctor already talk to you about the general anesthetic you’ll be getting?

Bruce: I don’t need a general anesthetic. I want to be conscious during the procedure.

Nurse: You’ll be inhaling a general anesthetic and getting an intravenous muscle relaxant. That’s standard for this procedure.

Bruce: I’m not a wimp. Tell the doctor all I need is a local anesthetic to numb the area.

Nurse: You’ll need something stronger. You don’t want to feel any sensation or pain during the procedure.

Bruce: I’m not afraid of a little pain. Bring it on!

Nurse: Anyway, the general anesthetic will wear off soon after the procedure. However, the doctor will keep you under sedation for the rest of the day so you can rest.

Bruce: Forget it. When it’s done, I’m going home. I’m not staying here overnight.

Nurse: That’s not advisable. You need to remain under observation for 24 hours.

Bruce: That’s for other people. I’m tough. I’ll be up and ready to go. What’s that needle for?

Nurse: It’s to give you a shot before your procedure.

Bruce: [whimpers] I don’t like needles. Get that away from me!

### 1244 Preparing Packages for Shipping

Suzanne: Pass me the packing tape. This box is ready to be sealed.

George: Wait! You can’t just send our product like that. It needs to be protected so it won’t break in transit.

Suzanne: That doesn’t speak well for our product, does it?

George: It has nothing to do with the quality of our product. It’s all about the quality of the packing. Hand me some bubble wrap.

Suzanne: Here.

George: See what I’m doing? I’m wrapping each product in two layers of bubble wrap, placing them in the box, and then filling in the gaps with packing peanuts. Got that?

Suzanne: Fine, I’ll pack it the way you want it. What about these smaller products? You want them packed in a box?

George: No, the smaller products should be shipped in padded mailers like these.

Suzanne: Should I wrap the product in bubble wrap first?

George: No, these padded mailers should protect them from impact.

Suzanne: Good. Let’s put on a label and be done with it.

George: Hold on. These boxes and mailers need to be taped up so they don’t open during shipping. Make sure all openings are sealed.

Suzanne: Okay, now are we done?

George: Sure, with this batch – just 64 more to go.

Suzanne: Uh!

### 1245 Measuring Mass and Volume

Andre: Three gallons of water.

Dana: Check.

Andre: A quart of lemon juice.

Dana: Got it.

Andre: A tablespoon of bleach.

Dana: Bleach?

Andre: Bleach. A pint of vinegar.

Dana: It’s in there.

Andre: A cup of baking soda.

Dana: Okay.

Andre: A teaspoon of liquid detergent.

Dana: Done.

Andre: A pound of bath salts.

Dana: A pound?

Andre: A pound. Three tablespoons of chlorine.

Dana: Okay.

Andre: An ounce of perfume.

Dana: Done. Do you really think this is necessary?

Andre: Have you smelled your stinky dog?!

### 1246 Getting a Gynecological Exam

Matt: Hello, viewers! On our show today, we have Dr. Rodriguez, who is here to tell us about women’s health. Welcome, Dr. Rodriguez.

Dr. Rodriguez: Thanks for having me.

Matt: Tell us. As a gynecologist, what one piece of advice would you give to women to help them stay healthy?

Dr. Rodriguez: Well, as part of their regular checkups, they should be getting a gynecological exam.

Matt: This may surprise you, but I’ve never had one. Ha, ha!

Dr. Rodriguez: When women come in for an exam, I check several things. I do a breast exam to check for lumps to detect breast cancer. I also show women how to do this at home on their own.

Matt: Is that all?

Dr. Rodriguez: No, I do a pelvic exam and a Pap smear to rule out cervical cancer. I also look for anything problematic, such as unusual discharge or signs of STDs.

Matt: That sounds painful. Ouch!

Dr. Rodriguez: It’s not painful and it’s very important. I also discuss with women their menstrual cycles, issues related to being sexually active, birth control methods, fertility issues, and menopause.

Matt: I didn’t know what I was missing!

Dr. Rodriguez: My point is that it’s important for women to talk to their doctor about any medical issues they may have.

Matt: And my point is: I’m glad I’m not a woman!

Dr. Rodriguez: That’s not the message . . .

Matt: Thanks for coming in, doctor. And now, let’s talk about something really important – celebrity news!

### 1247 Doing Meal Planning

Donny: Have you ever heard of something called a “meal plan”?

Helene: Sure, I make one each week before I go grocery shopping. It saves time and money.

Donny: My mother suggested I make one now that I’m staying home with the kids and Sydney is going back to work.

Helene: See this? This is my meal plan. I map out the dinners I’ll be making each day. It helps me a lot.

Donny: How? It seems like a lot of work.

Helene: Well, for one thing, I only have to go grocery shopping once a week. I buy a week’s worth of groceries in one fell swoop.

Donny: I guess that’s helpful, but it still seems like too much work.

Helene: Here’s what I do. I look at each week’s store circular to see what’s seasonal and on sale. I pull out my recipes that include those items and I see if I have any coupons I can use.

Donny: I still don’t see how I can save much money.

Helene: I also use the sale items for more than one meal and make enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day. It works like a charm.

Donny: I think I’ll stick to my original plan.

Helene: Which is?

Donny: To plead ignorance and ask my mother over to our house to give me cooking lessons. By the time I cook well enough on my own, the children will be nearly full-grown!

### 1248 Describing Old and New Equipment

Oleg: Geez, look at that dinosaur.

Raquel: This is not a dinosaur. It’s a classic. It will never go out of style and it’s built to last.

Oleg: It’s an antique and belongs in a museum. You’ve got to get with it and get one of these.

Raquel: What’s that?

Oleg: It’s the latest model, with cutting edge design. It’s brand spanking new.

Raquel: That’s all right. This machine is tried-and-true and it never lets me down.

Oleg: Why don’t you take this for a test drive? It’ll be an eye-opening experience for you.

Raquel: No, thanks.

Oleg: You don’t know what you’re missing.

Raquel: That’s true, but I’m happy with my machine.

Oleg: Fine. I’m just trying to help you move with the times.

Raquel: Thanks, but no thanks. I’ll stick with what I know and love.

Oleg: It just goes to show there’s no accounting for taste.

### 1249 Making Temporary Repairs

Desiree: Hey, what happened to the lights?

Chris: I think you have a short or maybe a loose wire.

Desiree: My guests are going to arrive any minute. What am I going to do?

Chris: Don’t worry. In an emergency, I’m your man. Whatever the problem is, I can probably find a stopgap solution.

Desiree: Are you sure? I don’t want you to get electrocuted.

Chris: When I was growing up, we lived in the middle of nowhere and my parents had to make do. They improvised all the time, using what was on hand to make repairs.

Desiree: They both sound very handy.

Chris: They did what they had to do. Whatever the problem was, they were able to cobble together something, even if it was a little makeshift. I like to think I learned a thing or two from them.

Desiree: So do you think you can fix this?

Chris: Well, it’s not going to be done properly, but I’ll jury-rig something so the lights will work temporarily until you can get it repaired professionally.

Desiree: That’s great, but just in case, I think I’ll run to the store for some candles.

### 1250 Dealing With Bossy People

Rachel: What you need to do is . . .

Logan: Stop bossing me around! I know what I’m doing so back off.

Rachel: What’s gotten into you? I’m not bossing you around. I’m trying to help you. Some people are so ungrateful.

Logan: It’s true that I’ve made my share of mistakes, but I don’t need you here to push me around calling all the shots.

Rachel: Here’s a reality check: Without me keeping an eye on you and steering you away from bad decisions, you’d be back in trouble again.

Logan: When I asked for your help, I’d forgotten how pushy and controlling you are. I’m not going to let you walk all over me like you did when we were kids.

Rachel: Who is trying to walk all over you? If you think I’m being high-handed then I’m out of here.

Logan: Good. I don’t know what possessed me to ask you for help in the first place.

Rachel: Well, things never change, do they?

Logan: Apparently not!

### 1251 Getting a Confession

Andy: I got it! I got a confession.

Diane: You got a confession out of that suspect? How did you do it? We’ve been after that guy for days.

Andy: I put the pressure on and he buckled.

Diane: Did you make threats?

Andy: Of course I made threats. It’s an interrogation, not a tea party.

Diane: The confession is no good if it’s coerced.

Andy: I may have gone over the line a little, but who’s to know?

Diane: He knows and any half-decent lawyer will make mincemeat out of that confession. He’ll get it thrown out of court in a heartbeat.

Andy: I leaned on him a little hard, but it’s not like I put the screws on him.

Diane: You have a lot to learn.

Andy: Do you think I should go back in there and talk to him?

Diane: Stay out of there. You’ve done enough damage. Rookies!

### 1252 Reneging on a Promise

Jean-Paul: What’s going on? I thought it was a done deal.

Charlene: I think you misunderstood. The last time we talked, I said I would think about partnering up, but now that I have, I’m going to beg off.

Jean-Paul: What you said was that you were agreeable to the idea and that we would work out the details later. Now you’re backtracking?

Charlene: I would never renege on a promise. If I gave my word, I would follow through. In this case, I didn’t.

Jean-Paul: I’m really surprised by your denial. I didn’t have you pegged as someone who backs out of deals.

Charlene: All I can say is that we don’t see eye to eye. Let’s agree to disagree and leave it at that.

Jean-Paul: That’s easy for you to say. Your failure to honor your promise is going to put me in a very awkward position.

Charlene: How’s that? We only spoke yesterday.

Jean-Paul: I may have made some promises of my own and now I’ll have to get out of them somehow.

Charlene: May I make a suggestion?

Jean-Paul: What? Deny, deny, deny?

Charlene: Well, it’s worked for me.

Jean-Paul: Oh, the nerve of some people!

### 1253 Using a Ridesharing Service

Carl: Let’s get a taxi.

Doris: There’s no need. I’ve already ordered a car.

Carl: A limo? That’s too expensive.

Doris: No, I’m using a ridesharing service. It’s cheaper than a taxi. There’s no meter and we pay a set price.

Carl: But how do we know it’s safe? How do we know the driver isn’t a criminal or an unsafe driver? Is he going to have car insurance? Do they do background checks?

Doris: Even though it’s a peer-to-peer service, the drivers are carefully screened and the cars are tracked. Trust me. This ride will be safe.

Carl: We don’t have much cash on us.

Doris: I have a credit card on file. No cash will change hands. Look, here’s our driver. Hello, Michael.

Carl: You know our driver?

Doris: He’s my son.

Carl: But why are you paying for a ride if your son is available to pick us up?

Doris: He has his pride. He won’t take any money from me so we came up with a compromise: I hire his car whenever I need a ride to or from the airport. It works for us and there’s a bonus.

Carl: What’s that?

Doris: I get to see my son every time I travel.

Carl: That seems like a strange arrangement.

Doris: That may be so, but if you can’t get your son to visit more often, what’s a mother to do?

### 1254 Being Under a Corrupting Influence

Ann: I don’t like our son watching those films and reading those books. They’re corrupting his mind.

Elio: I don’t like it either, but he’s old enough to read and watch what he likes without our interference.

Ann: But they’re brainwashing him! Those books and films are full of evil, perverted ideas.

Elio: They’re certainly blasphemous and profane. I agree with you. But what can we do? Maybe his interest in them will be short-lived.

Ann: Even if he loses interest, we’ll have to find a way to reverse the damage that’s been done. He’ll need to be deprogramed.

Elio: Maybe their effect will be short-lived, too. Deep down he’s a good kid. We both know that.

Ann: Yes, but those ideas are dangerous. I hope he doesn’t act on them.

Elio: Don’t even think it. That would spell disaster.

Ann: All right, I’ll only think good thoughts.

Elio: Good.

Ann: Where are you going?

Elio: I’m hoping for the best, but just in case, it doesn’t hurt to monitor what he’s saying on social media.

### 1255 Talking About Gemstones

Nathan: I’m looking for a gift for my girlfriend. Can you help me pick something out?

Ellie: I’d be happy to. We have a wide selection of jewelry with precious and semiprecious gemstones. Are you interested in something new or antique?

Nathan: I’m not sure. I’m just looking for something nice, something that really reflects our relationship.

Ellie: I understand. Let me show you some of our finest pieces. This ring has a polished faceted stone that has a lot of luster. Isn’t it exquisite?

Nathan: That’s beautiful, but it’s not really what I’m looking for.

Ellie: No problem. How about this piece? It has a lovely color and cut and it’s in a gold setting.

Nathan: Gold, huh? “Golden” isn’t how I’d describe our relationship, at least not yet.

Ellie: Okay, many of our semiprecious stones are set in silver. This one is really radiant, don’t you think?

Nathan: That’s okay, but what about these stones over here?

Ellie: Those are rough uncut stones. They need a lot of work before they’re ready for sale.

Nathan: Rough and needs work? That describes our relationship to a tee. I’ll take one of those.

### 1256 Describing Fast and Slow Speech

Jerome: Did you hear what the speaker said?

Elise: No, I didn’t catch that either. She’s racing through her presentation like she’s late for her train.

Jerome: I know. She speaks at such a fast rate of speech that it’s dizzying. I wish she’d slow down so I could make out what she’s saying. Most of it is mumbled or garbled.

Elise: She’s got to be breaking a record for the number of words per minute. Hey wait, she’s done. The next speaker has to be better.

Jerome: Oh my God, she’s worse! She must be the slowest speaker alive. Every utterance is drawn-out and every sentence seems interminable. She just keeps droning on and on and on.

Elise: At least we can understand her.

Jerome: Yes, but I wish she’d pick up the pace. She’s making a lengthy speech even longer. At this rate, we’ll be here until midnight!

Elise: Maybe we should try to pay attention and take notes like we’re supposed to.

Jerome: How can we when her voice is so hypnotic?

Elise: I know what you mean. I think I need some coffee. Do you want some?

Jerome: [snores]

Elise: Jerome, Jerome!

### 1257 Repairing Damage to an Auto Body

Miles: It’s something, isn’t it?

Yuki: Yeah, it’s something all right. Where did you get this heap?

Miles: My uncle sold it to me. This car has been sitting in his garage for years and he finally said I could have it for a good price. I need some auto body work done on it. There’s a little damage and I want to make it look good again.

Yuki: A little damage?! The bumpers are falling off and the frame is bent. Was this car in an accident? I’m worried about its structural integrity.

Miles: It was in a small accident, but none of these cosmetic things affects how it runs.

Yuki: I mean there are dents and dings everywhere, and paint scratches so deep you might need to get a whole new paint job.

Miles: I’m sure you can work your magic on it and make it look new again.

Yuki: Wait a second. There’s rust all over the undercarriage.

Miles: When do you think you can have it ready for me to pick up?

Yuki: It’s ready now.

Miles: Now?

Yuki: Yes, this car is ready for you to pick up and take to a salvage yard!

### 1258 Causes of Plane Crashes

Angelica: So the book I’m writing starts with a plane crash.

Corey: What caused it?

Angelica: It doesn’t matter. That’s not part of the story.

Corey: But characters have backstories, so you should have a backstory for the plane crash.

Angelica: Okay, the plane crashed because of mechanical failure, or better yet, pilot error.

Corey: What happened? Was it because the pilot misread the instruments or had a problem navigating?

Angelica: I don’t know.

Corey: Maybe he or she was incapacitated due to an illness. What kind of illness?

Angelica: Forget it. Let’s say instead that it happened because of an act of God.

Corey: Like a lightning strike? That’s not very likely.

Angelica: Okay, how about some problem with the flight crew that caused the cabin to depressurize and the plane to go into a tailspin.

Corey: What was the problem with the fight crew?

Angelica: It doesn’t matter!

Corey: Maybe a member of the flight crew was a hijacker and it was an act of terrorism.

Angelica: Okay, let’s say that’s what happened. Happy?

Corey: But wait! Who was the terrorist? What were his aims and what was his cause?

Angelica: You know what? I think you should put that in your book!

### 1259 Discovering a Family Secret

Kelly: [sniffling]

Yoon: What’s the matter? Are you okay?

Kelly: You know that my mother’s funeral was last weekend. I brought some of her papers home with me to sort through and I’ve had a shock.

Yoon: What? An old family secret? Some skeleton in the closet?

Kelly: It was for my mother. While reading some of her letters, I found out that she had a son out of wedlock when she was young and she gave the baby up for adoption.

Yoon: Wow, that’s a bombshell!

Kelly: Yeah, I feel like I’ve been sucker punched. This is life-changing.

Yoon: Maybe you can ask your aunts and uncles about it.

Kelly: But what if my mother didn’t disclose this to me for a reason? I don’t want to air her dirty laundry now that she’s gone.

Yoon: You wouldn’t be airing dirty laundry. A part of your family history has come to light and you have questions. That’s natural. And plus, you’re keeping it in the family.

Kelly: But maybe they’ll feel like I’m dredging up something they wish had been forgotten.

Yoon: Or maybe they’ve been waiting for a chance to talk about it. You haven’t mentioned the most shocking part.

Kelly: What’s that?

Yoon: You may have a half-brother somewhere out there.

Kelly: Oh my God, you’re right. That possibility is both thrilling and terrifying!

### 1260 Transport and Shipping Mishaps

Una: Get on the horn and find out where our cargo is.

Jackson: I’ve been trying. Last week, I finally reached someone at the transport company and all they would tell me was that due to unforeseen circumstances, there will be a delay in delivery.

Una: Didn’t they give you any details?

Jackson: None at all. When I called again two days later, I spoke with someone else who said there may have been a mishap in transit, such as a truck breakdown or accident.

Una: But our cargo is being shipped by sea.

Jackson: That’s what I told her. She said the delay could be due to something as simple as bad weather and that our cargo probably hasn’t been captured for ransom or lost at sea.

Una: Captured for ransom?! Lost at sea?!

Jackson: She said that probably hasn’t happened. When I called again yesterday, I was told the cargo had arrived at the port, but that there’s a problem.

Una: What kind of problem?

Jackson: The person I spoke to didn’t know, but thought that it could be a delay in customs clearance or even a loss of refrigeration.

Una: A loss of refrigeration?! That would be disastrous.

Jackson: I know, but then again, who thought transporting Alaska snow to California was a good idea?

Una: Our wonderful director, remember?

### 1261 Reading About Research on Health

Vivian: Wait! Don’t use that toaster.

Eric: Why? I want some toast for breakfast.

Vivian: It isn’t safe. I’ve just read about a research study that found people who use toasters have higher incidences of tumors.

Eric: That’s ridiculous. I’m having some toast with my coffee.

Vivian: You can’t use the coffee maker, either. The use of coffee makers is linked to heart disease.

Eric: Are you putting me on? Where are you getting this junk science?

Vivian: From very reputable sources.

Eric: I bet these so-called researchers are making sweeping conclusions and fraudulent claims based on limited or nonexistent data.

Vivian: Stop!

Eric: What now? I’m opening the refrigerator to get some milk.

Vivian: Refrigerators emit harmful rays that can be bad for your vision.

Eric: Wait a second. Are you having trouble sleeping again?

Vivian: As a matter of fact, I am. I haven’t slept in three days.

Eric: I don’t need any research study to tell me that people who don’t sleep think kooky thoughts!

### 1262 Failing a Driving Test

Oleg: I failed!

Daria: What?! How could you have failed your driving test again?

Oleg: I got nervous and I did everything wrong.

Daria: Like what?

Oleg: When I accelerated, I ground my gears and raced the engine. The car jerked so hard that the examiner nearly fell off her seat.

Daria: Oh, that’s bad.

Oleg: Yeah, I know. I failed to stop at a traffic light and changed lanes in the intersection without signaling.

Daria: Yikes.

Oleg: The examiner told me to back off because I was tailgating the car in front of me. She also pointed out the speed limit because I had been speeding.

Daria: It couldn’t have gone much worse, could it?

Oleg: Oh yes, it could have and it did. When she warned me about my speed, I got so flustered that I slammed on the brakes and nearly caused an accident.

Daria: What did she say when that happened?

Oleg: She cried uncle and told me to take her back to the office as fast as humanly possible!

### 1263 Bragging About Success With Men

Evan: Who are going out with tonight?

Chantelle: I’m not sure. I might go to dinner with Steve or Eduardo or Jim.

Evan: Dinner is in a couple of hours. You mean they’re waiting around for your call?

Chantelle: They’d better be. They’re the ones vying for my attention, so they’d better be at my beck and call.

Evan: How many guys are you juggling?

Chantelle: Not that many, only the ones who are really devoted admirers. I try to throw them a bone now and then.

Evan: By keeping them waiting.

Chantelle: It’s good to keep them on their toes.

Evan: And by making them jealous of each other? I saw how angry Jack got when he saw you flirting with Kwan and later getting cozy with Mike.

Chantelle: Jack can’t stay angry with me. We’ll kiss and make up.

Evan: Don’t you ever get tired of toying with so many men?

Chantelle: I’m not toying with them. It’s not my fault that men find me irresistible.

Evan: Right, just like moths to a flame. No wonder so many get burned!

### 1264 Customer Loyalty Programs

Wynn: I’ve come up with a surefire way to bring in more business.

Dixie: How?

Wynn: We’ll start a customer loyalty program. All of the big businesses have them.

Dixie: I’m not sure how they work.

Wynn: They’re mainly point-based systems. Our customers sign up and we’ll give them a membership card or keychain tag with a barcode. Each time they make a purchase, they get points. Once they’ve accumulated enough points, they can redeem them for rewards.

Dixie: Okay, but what’s this?

Wynn: It’s a punch card. Each time a customer buys something over $25, they get a punch. When they’ve received 10 punches, they get a $10 discount.

Dixie: I understand all that, but what is this chart for?

Wynn: It shows our new tiered system. Customers who spend over $1,000 a year are on the blue level, those who spend more than $5,000 are on the red level, and those who spend $10,000 are on the gold level. We’ll have incentives to get people to move up the ladder.

Dixie: So which of these customer loyalty programs are we adopting?

Wynn: All of them.

Dixie: Huh? How are customers supposed to keep track of all of these programs?

Wynn: Good question. See this? It’s a free wallet we’ll be giving away. Customers can keep all of their customer loyalty cards in it. Isn’t it nice?

Dixie: It’s nice, but will people really use it?

Wynn: You’ve got a point. Maybe we should come up with a reward program for those who do. Hey, that’s brilliant!

### 1265 Watching a Fight

Adrian: Hey, there’s a fight going on outside. Let’s go!

Paul: Those guys are really going at it.

Adrian: Yeah, they’re going all out. Did you see that? He just sucker punched the other guy.

Paul: They’re not really fighting fair, are they?

Adrian: No, this is a knock-down, drag-out fight – the best kind! Deck him!

Paul: I don’t really want to watch these guys pummeling each other. Want to go?

Adrian: Are you kidding?! This is the best entertainment I’ve seen in months. Nice uppercut, but watch out for the other guy’s jab. Oh, he just took a bad blow to the head.

Paul: This is getting ugly. Next we’ll get hair pulling.

Adrian: Oh, did you see that head-butt? I think we have a knockout.

Paul: Okay, if that’s true, then the fight is over. Can we leave now?

Adrian: Wait! The guy is getting up. I think we might get a second round. Hey, where are you going? You don’t have the stomach for a little fight?

Paul: It’s not the fight. What I can’t stomach is being around someone who is as bloodthirsty as you are!

### 1266 Being a Refugee

Sara: How’s work been?

Tarek: Really hard. Our agency is working to resettle refugees who have fled McQuillanland because of the armed conflict there.

Sara: It must be so difficult to be displaced and have few possessions.

Tarek: You don’t know the half of it. Some are in refugee camps and some are in detention centers. They’re overcrowded and the already poor conditions are deteriorating. There simply isn’t an infrastructure to support an influx this big.

Sara: At least they’re under protection until they can be resettled.

Tarek: If they’re resettled. If we can’t find countries willing to take them, they may be repatriated.

Sara: But what if they won’t go back?

Tarek: Then they’ll be stateless. There aren’t many good options for asylum seekers.

Sara: I feel so bad for everyone in McQuillanland.

Tarek: I totally agree. You’re damned if you leave and damned if you stay!

### 1267 Types of Nurses

Lillian: I’d like to become a nurse like you. I would have a great bedside manner.

Amos: It’s a difficult job, but I like it. I’m a registered nurse, but there are a lot of different types of nurses. If you’re willing to get an advanced degree, you could become a clinical nurse specialist or a nurse practitioner.

Lillian: I don’t think I want to spend a lot of time in school.

Amos: Then you just need a little more training after your bachelor’s degree. You can be a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, emergency room nurse, operating room nurse, critical care or intensive care nurse, or a home care nurse.

Lillian: Well, I dropped out of college. I just couldn’t hack it.

Amos: Hmm, then you might want to consider becoming a certified nursing assistant. You’ll still need to go through a training program, though, and to become certified.

Lillian: That still sounds like a lot of studying.

Amos: You do want to work in nursing, don’t you?

Lillian: I do, but I thought all I’d have to do is serve meals, talk to the patients, and make them comfortable. That’s what they do on TV.

Amos: Then my advice to you is to become an actor and play a nurse on TV. I think that might be the closest you’re going to get to the nursing profession.

### 1268 Conducting Employee Background Checks

Vanessa: I can’t wait until the new employees start work. We need the help.

Daniel: It won’t be for a while. Background checks have to be done first.

Vanessa: Background checks? Are those really necessary?

Daniel: You’d be surprised. We’ve been burned before. We don’t want to hire anyone with prior instances of negligence or anyone else who has been involved in a corporate scandal. Sometimes we even get people with fraudulent credentials.

Vanessa: Isn’t a background check kind of invasive? What do they check for, a criminal record?

Daniel: Yes, but that’s just the beginning. Investigators check driving records, credit reports, school transcripts, sex offender lists, and much more.

Vanessa: I had no idea.

Daniel: When someone runs your Social Security number, all kinds of things come up. Investigators also check court records and medical records.

Vanessa: That’s amazing.

Daniel: On top of all that, they often speak with past employers and character references.

Vanessa: And the new hires are okay with the company doing this kind of invasive background check?

Daniel: You were.

Vanessa: Me?! You mean they ran a background check on me before I was hired?

Daniel: You bet.

Vanessa: So they know all about . . .

Daniel: What?

Vanessa: Forget it.

### 1269 Problems with the Heating System

[Doorbell rings]

Dan: Hello, I’m Dan. I’m here to fix your heating system.

Janice: Oh, when I put in the service call, I didn’t expect a repairperson to come out the same day.

Dan: I just finished another repair in the neighborhood and the company told me to come by. How long has it been on the fritz?

Janice: Well, the boiler hasn’t worked for two months. We used it to heat the basement.

Dan: But you just called for repairs today.

Janice: I didn’t call about the boiler. I called about our radiators. The radiators heat the original part of the house. But we’re also having problems with the furnace for our central heating system, which heats the extension.

Dan: You mean you have two different heating systems in one house?

Janice: It’s an old house. Each system was installed at a different time.

Dan: So you could have problems with more than one thermostat, heating element, fan, or set of ductwork.

Janice: I know that we should install one system for the whole house, but that would be expensive.

Dan: More expensive than fixing two separate systems?

Janice: Is this going to cost a lot?

Dan: I’m afraid so.

Janice: Well, we can’t afford expensive repairs. I guess we’ll have to use these.

Dan: What are those?

Janice: Space heaters.

### 1270 Cold and Frozen Treats

Miranda: Mmm, I could really go for an ice cream sundae right now.

Luca: I was thinking more like a cup of hot cocoa.

Miranda: Forget that. A banana split with ice cream and lots of chocolate sauce topped with whipped cream – mmm.

Luca: I like chocolate, too, but hot chocolate sounds much better.

Miranda: Oh, maybe we could run to the store for some popsicles and ice cream sandwiches. Those would really hit the spot.

Luca: Some mulled cider is more like it for me.

Miranda: If only we had a snow cone machine. We could make our own snow cones!

Luca: How about a hot toddy instead?

Miranda: No way! Do you think the frozen yogurt store is still open at this hour?

Luca: You do know that it’s the middle of winter, right?

Miranda: I know, but I can’t help it. I need to cool off.

Luca: Hot flashes again?

Miranda: That’s right. I wonder if the pool is frozen.

### 1271 Disapproving of a Remarriage

Ellie: I don’t believe it. I just got off the phone with my mother and she dropped a bombshell.

Laurent: What did she tell you?

Ellie: She’s thinking of remarrying.

Laurent: Are your parents divorced?

Ellie: No, my mother is a widow. My father passed away eight years ago.

Laurent: Oh, I’m sorry. You don’t approve of your prospective stepfather?

Ellie: Uh, don’t use that term. I don’t like or dislike him. It’s just that my mother should not be remarrying – period. She should stay true to my father’s memory.

Laurent: After eight years?

Ellie: Theirs was a picture-perfect marriage. How could she forget about it and take up with this other guy?

Laurent: Don’t you want your mother to move on and be happy?

Ellie: By replacing my father with this new guy?

Laurent: I’m sure she’s not trying to replace him. She just wants a new love in her life.

Ellie: My father was the love of her life. This other guy is a pale substitute.

Laurent: Can’t you just be happy for her?

Ellie: I’m never betraying my father’s memory.

Laurent: Does that mean you’ll never marry?

Ellie: Well, no, I can stay true to my father’s memory and still get married.

Laurent: So can your mother!

### 1272 Returning and Exchanging Merchandise

Clerk: Hello, how can I help you?

Spencer: I’d like to return a few things I received over the holidays.

Clerk: Okay, do you have gift receipts?

Spencer: I do for this item. It’s unopened and unused.

Clerk: Let me see. I can give you a refund, but there will be a small restocking fee.

Spencer: Really?

Clerk: I’m afraid so.

Spencer: Okay, that’s fine. I also received this one as a gift, but don’t have a receipt.

Clerk: Let me look up that merchandise in our system. It looks like it was a clearance item and it was a final sale.

Spencer: But it’s unworn.

Clerk: I understand that. The best I can do is to allow you to exchange it if it doesn’t fit or give you store credit.

Spencer: I’ll take the store credit. What about this?

Clerk: Let me see. That item was purchased on our online store and it can’t be returned to a store location, only through our website.

Spencer: And this? It doesn’t work.

Clerk: I’m sorry, but that was also a clearance item and was sold in as-is condition.

Spencer: [sigh] All right.

Clerk: Can I help you with anything else?

Spencer: Only if you can visit the other three stores to return the rest of my gifts.

Clerk: You didn’t get you wanted for the holidays, huh?

Spencer: My family and friends have great senses of humor, but how many gag gifts can one man own?

### 1273 Improving School Security

Roberto: All right, let’s get started. I organized this faculty and staff meeting to talk about ideas to improve school security.

Ginny: But we already have controlled access to school buildings, and all of the staff and faculty wear ID badges.

Roberto: Those measures help to keep people out of our school who don’t belong here. But in light of what’s happened at other schools, we need to do more to keep students safe.

Ginny: You mean in the event of bomb threats and mass shootings?

Roberto: Those are some of the threats we have to prepare for.

Ginny: I don’t know how we can prepare for those things.

Roberto: Well, we might consider security cameras and armed guards to patrol the school.

Ginny: Really?

Roberto: Really. We need to develop evacuation plans or procedures for lockdown in the event of an imminent threat.

Ginny: This is scary stuff.

Roberto: We live in scary times.

Ginny: It’s starting to feel like we work in a prison, not a school!

### 1274 Childish Fighting and Misbehavior.

Mitch: How was work today?

Nancy: Terrible. Nobody could get along and the name-calling started early.

Mitch: Did anybody throw a tantrum or act out in some other way?

Nancy: Several did. At one point, a couple of them stomped out and slammed the door, but they eventually came back. I wish they’d given each other the silent treatment instead.

Mitch: So there was yelling?

Nancy: Lots of yelling. They tried to talk over each other and wouldn’t take turns. After a while, I wanted to demand some quiet time, but no one would have paid me any attention.

Mitch: That sounds like a lot of posturing. At least it didn’t devolve into hitting and biting.

Nancy: Not yet, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there is plenty of that next week when the Congressional subcommittee on peacekeeping meets again.

### 1275 Working as a Musician

Harry: Our gig for this weekend is cancelled. They booked somebody else earlier but forgot.

Debbie: That’s a big bummer. I was counting on that gig to pay rent.

Harry: Maybe I can get some session work at the studio.

Debbie: I’m so sick of being broke all the time.

Harry: I know, but this is our dream. We want to be working musicians with a recording contract and worldwide tours, right? We agreed to devote all our time and energy to our music.

Debbie: That was the dream. The reality is that we’re not doing too well. I’m thinking of packing it in.

Harry: You can’t! We agreed to give ourselves five years to make it. We both agreed that it’s better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all.

Debbie: But don’t you ever feel like giving up?

Harry: No! All we need is one big break.

Debbie: All right. I don’t want to think about it anymore. Let’s rehearse.

Harry: I can’t. I’ve got to go.

Debbie: Where to?

Harry: To my brother’s restaurant. I agreed to wash dishes there tonight.

Debbie: What happened to devoting all our time and energy to our music?

Harry: Even people with dreams have to eat.

### 1276 Using an On-site Daycare

Francesca: Hey, don’t we have a meeting at 1:30?

Jorge: We do. Sorry I’m late. I popped over to see how my kids are doing in the new on-site daycare.

Francesca: I didn’t even know we had an on-site daycare.

Jorge: It’s something new the company is offering to working parents. It’s a big perk and it’s great not having to drop off and pick up my kids from a separate daycare every day.

Francesca: That’s nice.

Jorge: It’s really helped with the transition back to work from maternity and paternity leave. Finding the right childcare was turning out to be a big problem.

Francesca: We really missed you when you were away.

Jorge: Thanks. I’m also less distracted. I have peace of mind knowing the kids are here in the same building and I can check on them anytime. It’s better for productivity.

Francesca: That’s good. Now should we get started with our meeting?

Jorge: Okay, but let’s keep it short. I want to check on the kids again in about 10 minutes.

Francesca: How many times have you checked on them already?

Jorge: Four times.

Francesca: Just today?

Jorge: Just in the past hour.

### 1277 Inconsiderate Subway/Train Passengers

Amanda: I love the subway.

Felix: I do, too, but it really annoys me when people hog more than one seat, like that guy over there.

Amanda: Yeah, and I hate it when you’re trying to get on the train and the passengers who are blocking the doors won’t move out of the way.

Felix: Oh, even worse is when you’re trying to get off the train and people who want to get on won’t wait until you get off.

Amanda: That’s totally annoying!

Felix: Even worse is when the train is full and people squeeze to get on when there’s no more room!

Amanda: So true! I also hate it when people fall asleep and start invading my space. Last week, a guy fell asleep next to me and dropped into my lap. Gross!

Felix: What about when you’re holding onto a pole and somebody’s hand bumps yours and they don’t move away? That’s really annoying.

Amanda: Oh look, there’s a pregnant woman on the other end of the train and those guys aren’t giving up their seats for her. What jerks!

Felix: Yeah, what jerks! At least we don’t have any singers, dancers, or loud entertainers on this train. I hate it when they start performing.

Amanda: Actually, I kind of like it when people perform. It helps to pass the time.

Felix: Yeah, now that I think about it, I guess I do, too. I love the subway.

Amanda: Me, too.

### 1278 Applying to a Selective School

Sam: I think our child should go to a public school. I did.

Yasmin: I went to a private prep school and I think it gave me a leg up in life.

Sam: I got where I am without a fancy prep school.

Yasmin: And that’s great, but I think we should give our daughter every advantage we can.

Sam: What do you have in mind?

Yasmin: I have information here from a few of the most selective schools. Some are parochial and some are secular. Some are day schools and some are boarding schools.

Sam: I’m not sending my daughter to a boarding school and that’s final.

Yasmin: But some of the most exclusive schools are boarding schools.

Sam: I’m not budging on that. I want her coming home every day.

Yasmin: All right. Let’s look at the admission criteria for the remaining schools. Wow, admission is really competitive. These have very low admission rates.

Sam: Really?

Yasmin: Really. They also require two aptitude tests in addition to transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an interview.

Sam: Do we really want to put our daughter through that? And look at the tuition!

Yasmin: Is that for all four years?

Sam: No, for one year.

Yasmin: You’re kidding.

Sam: I’m not. Public school is sounding better and better, isn’t it?

### 1279 Baking for People with Dietary Restrictions

Gemma: I think we should have a bake sale. We’ll raise lots of money for our school.

Sebastian: A bake sale sounds good, but it’s too much trouble.

Gemma: How much trouble can it be to bake a few cookies and cakes?

Sebastian: It’s not as simple as that. We have to be careful selling baked goods to people with dietary restrictions.

Gemma: Like what?

Sebastian: Some people have ethical concerns. Vegans, for example, don’t want any animal products in their food.

Gemma: Like eggs and milk?

Sebastian: That’s right. And other people have medical problems or conditions. Diabetics, for instance, want their baked goods made with sugar substitutes, and people who are lactose intolerant want dairy substitutes.

Gemma: No sugar? No dairy?

Sebastian: And there is a whole slew of allergies to consider, like people who have celiac disease, those who can’t eat gluten, and those who are allergic to wheat or peanuts.

Gemma: Wow, when did life get so complicated? How about a rummage sale instead?

Sebastian: Good idea.

### 1280 Describing Poor Audio Quality

Young: We have a major problem. The audio on the new presentation is really awful.

Silvia: Really? Let me listen to it. Oh, the volume fluctuates and keeps cutting out. We even have long periods of dead air!

Young: That’s only one of the many problems. Keep listening and you’ll hear lots of static in the background. Sometimes it’s so loud that it drowns out all other sounds.

Silvia: Oh no, the voices are distorted, too. Some speakers sound garbled and others sound muffled.

Young: And when you can make out what the speakers are saying, their voices are tinny.

Silvia: What are we going to do?

Young: I guess we can try to remaster it and see if we can make any improvements.

Silvia: What if we can’t?

Young: Worse comes to worst? We’ll use captions!

### 1281 Going to the Playground

Patrick: Hi, do you mind if I sit on this bench with you?

Mary: No, be my guest. We’ve just moved to the neighborhood and we love having a playground around the corner.

Patrick: It’s nice, isn’t it, to be able to bring the kids here to get some exercise and to burn off some energy?

Mary: Definitely. I’m watching my daughter on that spring rider. It’s her favorite. Is that your son on the slide?

Patrick: It is. Over there, I have two other sons playing on the merry-go-round. They’re the ones wearing green.

Mary: Oh, yeah, I see them. Do you have other kids?

Patrick: My son Frankie and daughter Terese are on the jungle gym hanging on the monkey bars. See them?

Mary: Oh, sure. Are those two on the seesaw yours, too?

Patrick: They are, and those three boys on the swings are mine, too. Over there, you’ll see another one of my sons swinging on the trapeze rings, and right here is my youngest playing in the sandbox.

Mary: Wait, how many children do you have?

Patrick: Only 11.

### 1282 Working in a Scientific Field

Ira: It’s amazing that everybody in your family works in the sciences.

Shirley: Yeah, my parents are both in the social sciences. My father is a psychologist and my mother is an economist.

Ira: And your sister Shonda?

Shirley: She’s an astronomer. She initially wanted to study physics, but changed her mind. Her partner is a geologist.

Ira: Is your brother also in astronomy?

Shirley: No, he’s a biologist and his wife does chemistry research.

Ira: How about your other brother? What does he do?

Shirley: Um, we don’t . . . I mean he’s not involved in the social sciences, life sciences, or physical sciences.

Ira: If I remember correctly, he was always good at math and liked computers. Is he in computer science?

Shirley: No, he’s not. All right, he’s a writer, but we have every confidence that he’ll grow out of it.

### 1283 Forgetting Someone’s Birthday

Gretchen: I thought you were going out with your girlfriend tonight. What are you doing here watching TV?

Hugh: She’s mad at me.

Gretchen: Why?

Hugh: I forgot her birthday. It was last Tuesday and it completely slipped my mind. I forgot to put a reminder on my calendar. She’s moping and giving me the silent treatment.

Gretchen: What are you going to do to make up for forgetting her birthday?

Hugh: I’m just going wait it out and let it blow over. She’ll get over it.

Gretchen: Are you sure you don’t want to get her a belated birthday present?

Hugh: I’ll double up next year. I’ll get her something really special then.

Gretchen: I don’t think it works that way. She’s not going to forget that you forgot her birthday. That’s always going to be sore spot.

Hugh: It’s not like I did something really bad that I have to atone for. I forgot. What’s the big deal?

Gretchen: Okay, you know best, but if I were her . . .

Hugh: You’re not her. I apologized. Sooner or later, she’ll realize she’s blown this completely out of proportion and she owes me an apology.

Gretchen: Okay, if you say so.

### 1284 Discovering a Minor Theft

Maria: What’s going on here? I came as soon as I got your phone call. Why are you holding onto my son like that?

Store Owner: I am restraining your son because I caught him shoplifting. I thought you’d like to be here when I called the police.

Maria: There’s no need for that. He’s not a delinquent.

Store Owner: He is from my standpoint. Theft is a serious crime.

Maria: I know it is and I’ll make restitution. Please give him a second chance. Please don’t call the police.

Store Owner: Well, it’s not the value of what he’s stolen that’s important. It’s the fact that he committed an offense.

Maria: Please let me pay for it and I’ll make sure he never enters your store again. What did he take and how much do I owe you?

Store Owner: I told you that it’s not the cost of the item. It’s the principle.

Maria: What exactly did my son take?

Store Owner: He ate a grape.

Maria: One grape?

Store Owner: Yes, before I stopped him. He could have eaten the entire fruit stand if I hadn’t been vigilant.

Maria: All this is over one grape.

Store Owner: You should be thanking me for alerting you to this behavior. As a parent, you know you need to nip these things in the bud. Today it’s a grape; tomorrow it’s a car!

Maria: [sigh] Okay, how much do I owe you for one grape?

### 1285 Types of Commendations

Marissa: Can you believe it? We’ve received over 100 entries for the science fair.

Santiago: That’s great! We now need to decide what types of awards to hand out.

Marissa: Everybody likes money. How about a cash prize?

Santiago: We’re working with a very small budget here. We can’t afford a cash prize, and I’m not sure that it would send the right message anyway.

Marissa: The next best thing is a trophy.

Santiago: We don’t have the budget for trophies if we plan to give out more than one commendation.

Marissa: Then how about medals?

Santiago: We can’t afford good ones and nobody wants a cheap plastic medal.

Marissa: So I guess plaques are out, too?

Santiago: I’m afraid so. I was thinking of ribbons, different color ribbons for different prizes. What do you think?

Marissa: I guess ribbons would be okay. After all, it’s the praise and recognition that matters.

Santiago: Exactly. And for those getting honorable mentions, a certificate will do. We’ll also need certificates of participation for the rest.

Marissa: So everybody gets something?

Santiago: That’s right. We don’t want anyone to leave empty-handed.

Marissa: Even if their entry isn’t worthy of recognition?

Santiago: All entries are worthy of recognition – just some more than others.

### 1286 Experiencing Headaches

Lupe: Why are you lying on the couch with the lights out? Oh, you poor thing. Do you have a headache?

Eiji: Yes, a very bad one. My head is throbbing.

Lupe: Why don’t I get you some hot tea? That always helps me when I have a pounding headache.

Eiji: No, I just want to lie here quietly.

Lupe: I know that when I have a tension headache, it always eases the pain when someone massages my neck and shoulders. Would you like that?

Eiji: No, I don’t think it’s a tension headache. It came on suddenly.

Lupe: Then it’s not a sinus headache either? Are you feeling pain around your cheekbones?

Eiji: No, it’s not a sinus headache. I feel a little nauseous actually.

Lupe: Ah, then it must be a migraine. That explains the dark room and the need for quiet. I know the perfect cure for a migraine.

Eiji: Me, too, but I don’t have it here.

Lupe: I’d be happy to get it for you.

Eiji: Great. The only place that stocks it is in the next town.

Lupe: But that’s over two hours away.

Eiji: If it’s too much trouble . . .

Lupe: No, no, I’ll go. But how will you manage while I’m gone?

Eiji: I’ll just have to find a way to muddle through.

### 1287 Using Adapters and Converters

Ben: Wait! Don’t plug that into the socket. You’ll fry that old hair dryer.

Nicola: I can’t, anyway. This plug has two prongs and that socket is designed for three prongs.

Ben: That’s why I brought these adapters and this combination converter and transformer. Our devices will either not work or be ruined if we try plugging them directly into those outlets.

Nicola: I should have bought a travel hair dryer with dual voltage.

Ben: You’d still need an adapter.

Nicola: Whatever. Okay, I’ve put them both on. Now can I dry my hair?

Ben: You can’t use that hair dryer because the cord is frayed. If you turn it on, it may short circuit and then blow a fuse. We’d be without electricity.

Nicola: What am I supposed to do then?

Ben: Good thing I brought mine. Let me just check that the outlet is grounded. Yeah, I think it’s safe for you to use this one.

Nicola: I won’t get electrocuted?

Ben: You won’t even get a little singed.

### 1288 Being a Job-Hopper

Simon: Hey Maggie, I just stopped by to say good-bye. This is my last week.

Maggie: What? You’re leaving? You’re not being fired, are you?

Simon: No, I have another job lined up. It’s with a bigger company.

Maggie: But you’ve worked here for less than a year. You’re quitting?

Simon: Yeah, I’ve been putting out feelers for the past couple of months. I’m ready for a change.

Maggie: Are you sure this is the right move? You don’t want to be labeled as a job-hopper.

Simon: I appreciate your concern, but I’m not a lifer, that’s for sure.

Maggie: But you’ve moved three times in the past three years. Aren’t you afraid of being considered unstable or disloyal? It’s normally considered career suicide to move from job to job.

Simon: I know that some people spend 20 years in the same company, climbing the corporate ladder and working toward their pension, but that’s just not me.

Maggie: Aren’t you afraid companies won’t invest in you because they’re afraid you’ll jump ship?

Simon: Nope. It hasn’t happened yet.

Maggie: Well, then I wish you all the best. Maybe I’ll cross paths with you again in your twentieth or thirtieth job.

### 1289 Problems With Drinking Water

Yulia: Wait! Don’t drink that.

Jack: Why not? I’m really thirsty.

Yulia: That’s a standing pool of water. There could be all kinds of microorganisms living in there.

Jack: Fine, but somebody should have brought more water for this long walk.

Yulia: I know. It’s my fault. Hey, there’s a cabin. Maybe there’s somebody there who can give us some water. Do you see a well?

Jack: No, no well, and I don’t see an outdoor faucet either. In fact, I don’t see any signs of life inside. But hey, the door is unlocked.

Yulia: Are you sure we should just walk in?

Jack: I’m not dying of thirst just because you’re afraid to go in. Oh no! Nothing comes out of the tap. Let’s see if there are any water tanks or rain barrels out back.

Yulia: I’m not drinking rainwater or runoff from the roof.

Jack: Suit yourself, but here’s a tub of water.

Yulia: Wait! You don’t know if that’s potable. It could be untreated water with sewage or worse.

Jack: You can wait for some nice filtered water, but I’m not picky. I just need to quench my thirst.

Yulia: You should at least boil it first. Oh my God, I just saw something swimming in it!

Jack: I’m sure it’s willing to share.

### 1290 Describing Car Speed and Power

Martin: Did you see that? It’s the new McQ. It does 0 to 60 in four seconds. It has amazing performance.

Asta: That car? I guess it’s nice. I like the color.

Martin: Color?! Who cares about the color? The McQ is supposed to top out at 155, but it’s been clocked at 160. Can you imagine?

Asta: No, I can’t.

Martin: It has more horsepower than any car on the market and amazing torque. You wouldn’t believe the RPMs.

Asta: So it can go fast?

Martin: Yeah, it can go fast. It’s supposed to be really responsive, too, and the reviews say that the acceleration is really smooth. I bet that’s because of the tuning.

Asta: I like cars with more trunk space.

Martin: You don’t drive a car like the McQ for its storage capacity. You drive it for speed.

Asta: My cousin doesn’t like it that much. He says it doesn’t have enough legroom.

Martin: What?! Your cousin owns a McQ?

Asta: Yes, but he only drives it when his Ediger is in the shop.

Martin: How is it possible that I’ve known you for years and this is the first time you’ve mentioned this cousin to me? You know that I’m the biggest car enthusiast in the world, don’t you?

Asta: My cousin isn’t in town very often. He’s usually traveling to races.

Martin: Your cousin is a race car driver?

Asta: Yes, didn’t I mention that either?

### 1291 Types of Metal

Raquel: You’re not going to believe what my client wants for the finishes in their new house.

Chris: You’re the interior decorator to the rich and famous, so nothing would surprise me.

Raquel: My client wants only precious metals. He wants his bathroom fixtures to be made of platinum and gold.

Chris: You’re kidding! Stainless steel, bronze, or nickel ones aren’t good enough for him?

Raquel: Not even close. I suggested some aluminum light fixtures for the living room and he told me he wanted solid silver.

Chris: But for the kitchen, there’s got to be more run-of-the-mill metals, like tin or copper, right?

Raquel: He hasn’t asked me to stock the kitchen yet, but if he does, I wouldn’t be surprised if he asked for titanium forks!

Chris: Yours is a strange job, catering to the wishes of the rich.

Raquel: That’s true, but it’s taught me a lot.

Chris: What?

Raquel: To truly appreciate the ordinary!

### 1292 Being a Victim of Extortion

Jason: Hey, that guy just took merchandise without paying. Didn’t you see him?

Ida: Yeah, but it’s okay. Forget about it.

Jason: What’s going on here? Why did you just let that guy take things without paying?

Ida: If you must know, I’m paying for protection.

Jason: Protection? From whom?

Ida: Those guys. They rule this neighborhood. If a business doesn’t pay up, they resort to violence.

Jason: You mean this is a shakedown? They’re threatening you with violence unless you pay?

Ida: Yes, but what else can I do? All of the businesses on this street pay, one way or another.

Jason: But a protection racket is extortion. It’s against the law. You could tell the police.

Ida: The last person who squealed had his store torched. I’m not going up against these guys. Things could get ugly, really ugly. Are you leaving?

Jason: Yeah, I’m going to try to find that that guy who was here and talk to him, tell him to lay off you.

Ida: You can’t do that! Those guys mean business. They’ll hurt you.

Jason: Not a chance. When I tell them you’re under my protection, they’ll lay off for sure.

Ida: Stop! I’m not letting you stick your neck out for me. Your funeral won’t be on my head!

### 1293 Types of Body Noises

Ann: I’ve had it. Jim has got to go!

Milo: Go? He’s my best friend. I told him he could stay here until he got back on his feet. He’s not in your way, is he?

Ann: He doesn’t have to get in my way for me to know he’s in the house all the time. He snores so loudly I can hear him from our bedroom. He’s constantly hiccupping and wheezing, too.

Milo: Well, the guy can’t help it if he snores, hiccups, or wheezes.

Ann: But he can help snorting when he laughs and whistling all the time. And he constantly cracks his knuckles and it’s driving me up the wall.

Milo: Those are bad habits. You know it’s hard to break bad habits.

Ann: And what about his burping all through dinner and farting in the living room? That’s disgusting!

Milo: Okay, I’ll talk to him. I’m sure he’s not aware he’s doing most of these things. He’s always lived alone.

Ann: Really? I wonder why.

### 1294 Chaperoning a Field Trip

Rupi: I don’t think I’m cut out for this. How am I supposed to chaperone a class of students on a field trip?

Antonia: I thought you were gung-ho about being a chaperone for Nadia and the rest of her class on their trip to the children’s museum. That’s why you volunteered.

Rupi: I was, but then I started reading this material the school sent me to prepare for the trip. I have so many duties.

Antonia: Like what?

Rupi: I’m supposed to supervise the children all the time, escorting them to the restrooms and making sure they don’t misbehave. I don’t know what to do if the kids get out of hand.

Antonia: It’s not an overnight trip, just a morning at the museum.

Rupi: I know, but I’m responsible for their safety. What if I have to give first aid?

Antonia: The teacher will be there. He’ll know what to do in a real emergency.

Rupi: But how am I supposed to keep track of so many kids?

Antonia: Not all of the students are going on the trip, just the ones with signed permission slips.

Rupi: Even so, it’s a big responsibility. There are so many things that can go wrong.

Antonia: Do you want me to go in your place?

Rupi: Yes! No, I already told Nadia I’ll be going and she’s really excited. I don’t want to disappoint her.

Antonia: You’ll be absolutely fine. I’m sure it won’t be like last time.

Rupi: Last time?

Antonia: Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.

### 1295 Buying a Watch

Clerk: Hello, are you shopping for a watch for yourself?

Jack: Yes, I’m looking for a dress watch, something understated with a simple face.

Clerk: We have plenty to choose from. Let me show you these quartz watches.

Jack: I’m looking for something with an automatic movement, something that is self-winding.

Clerk: Oh, in that case, let me show you these. These have the finest workmanship you’ll find anywhere, with very hard crystals. Are you looking for something with a bezel? A leather strap or a metal one?

Jack: I’m not sure. My diving watch has a bezel and chronograph, but I’m looking for something simpler. What’s the difference between these two?

Clerk: This one has luminous hands and dial and is waterproof, and the other doesn’t have either feature.

Jack: Hmm, I can’t decide. I’ll take this one, this one, and this one.

Clerk: All three?

Jack: Yes.

Clerk: Let me show you these diamond-encrusted watches we just got in.

Jack: You think I need more than four watches?

Clerk: No man of style would be without at least a dozen.

### 1296 Taking a Buyout

Hector: So, are you taking the company buyout? It sounds generous.

Erica: Of course it’s generous. The company saves a lot of money by giving buyouts to senior employees with high salaries. What they get in return is a huge savings. I’ve been giving it a lot of thought, but I’m still not sure what to do.

Hector: It makes sense for me to take the buyout, since I’m only two years from retirement. It would bridge the gap nicely.

Erica: Yeah, but for someone like me? I’m mid-career and the job market is tight. There’s no guarantee I’ll land another job that pays as well as this one.

Hector: It’s tempting, though, isn’t it, to take a lump sum? You can take time to consider your options.

Erica: My options might be limited. No, I can’t take the risk. I’m staying.

Hector: Well, I’m leaving.

Erica: Sure?

Hector: Sure, I’m sure. A chance to say goodbye to the rat race? I’ll be the first one out the door.

### 1297 Types of Neighborhoods

Shari: Okay, ready to see more homes? I’ve lined up several for you to view this afternoon.

Ron: Yes, I’m ready. It’s hard finding just the right type of neighborhood to move to.

Shari: Yes, it’s been difficult, hasn’t it? How long have I been showing you homes?

Ron: About three months.

Shari: That’s right. First we looked at homes in planned and gated communities and in the bedroom communities around the city, as you requested.

Ron: That’s right. At first, I thought I wanted a quiet place to live in my retirement.

Shari: That’s why I also showed you homes in retirement communities.

Ron: Yes, but once I saw them, I changed my mind. I’m retired, but I’m not dead. I decided I wanted a livelier neighborhood, someplace with more action.

Shari: That’s why I showed you homes in the historic district and in the redeveloped waterfront area, both of which are very pedestrian-friendly.

Ron: Yes, but the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to be in the middle of the action.

Shari: That’s why, today, I’m taking you to the urban core. We’ll look at homes in the downtown area, the arts district, and a couple of ethnic enclaves. We’ll visit some high-priced neighborhoods and some up-and-coming.

Ron: Great! I think house-hunting has given me a new lease on life. This is fun! I could look at home after home after home.

Shari: That’s what I’m afraid of.

### 1298 Claiming Credit for an Invention

Kitty: Wait a second. We invented the Macanator. It was one of the most important technical achievements of our country.

Alberto: What? You can’t claim credit for the Macanator. We beat you to it.

Kitty: You may have invented the precursor to the modern-day Macanator, but we’re the ones who are the recognized inventors.

Alberto: That’s disputed. Just because we didn’t document the achievement, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.

Kitty: You mean it’s a case of “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?”

Alberto: I don’t think so.

Kitty: The fact is, you can try to rebut our claims all you like, but you still have no proof.

Alberto: The proof is in the pudding. Don’t we make the best Macanators in the world today?

Kitty: That’s beside the point. Okay, I will concede that your country makes the best Macanators today, if you’ll concede that we invented it.

Alberto: Never!

### 1299 Trading Insults

Alan: Look at you! Did you get a haircut or did your head get stuck in a weed whacker?

Doris: Look who’s talking. Maybe you should do something different with your hair, like wash it.

Alan: Oh, burn. That would have been a nice comeback if it weren’t so dumb. Who taught you your one-liners? A friend? Oh, I forgot. You don’t have any.

Doris: I think you’ve confused me with someone else – you!

Alan: You couldn’t come up with your own put-down so you had to borrow mine? How humiliating for you.

Doris: Not as humiliating as having to walk around with that face. I have something that’ll improve it: a paper bag!

Alan: Oh, clever. I knew better insults when I was six years old.

Doris: You mean the same mental age you are now?

Alan: Give it up. Nobody can one-up me in trading insults. Your brain is no match for mine.

Doris: You’re right. You’re a person of rare intelligence. You rarely show any!

### 1300 Diversifying a Workforce

Audrey: Have you seen these design ideas? They’re stale.

Simon: Maybe it’s time we diversified our workforce. It’s pretty homogenous right now.

Audrey: It’s not that homogeneous. We have people from different cultures and backgrounds, people who are bilingual and multicultural.

Simon: That’s not what I mean and you know it. We’re missing a huge demographic. Having more diversity will help us find new ways to tackle problems and come up with creative ideas.

Audrey: Are you saying we’ve become stodgy? I’m not adverse to change, you know.

Simon: I know that.

Audrey: But how will the rest of the company react?

Simon: I don’t know, but a more diverse workforce will also prevent discrimination lawsuits. That’s the reality we live in.

Audrey: I really don’t know. Do you really think hiring more men to design women’s bras is a good idea?

Simon: Of course. We have a unique appreciation for them.

### 1301 Describing Very Large and Small Sizes

Ian: Oh, look at your team. How cute! You’ve recruited the puniest players you could find.

Shannon: Are those your players? They’re humungous!

Ian: My players are the best around. They’re massive in size and massive in talent. They’ll crush your teeny-tiny team without breaking a sweat.

Shannon: Our teams are supposed to have players from the same age group, so why is it that I have normal-size players and yours are gigantic? Something doesn’t smell right.

Ian: It all comes down to recruitment. I recruited the best players.

Shannon: Are you sure you don’t have a few ringers on your team, some who are a few years older than they’re supposed to be?

Ian: Of course I don’t. I can’t help it if the best players gravitated toward my team and to my better coaching. Ready to be schooled?

Shannon: I think I’d better give my team a pep talk first. A few of them look like they’re ready to bolt – or throw up!

### 1302 Complaining About Parents

Winnie: I can’t believe it. My dad is so clueless.

Finn: What did he do now?

Winnie: He gave me permission to go to Gabi’s party, but I have to be home by 11 p.m. because of my curfew.

Finn: At least he’s letting you go. My mom is so overprotective that she won’t let me go to any parties.

Winnie: Unbelievable! Do your parents get on your case all the time like mine do?

Finn: Yeah! My mom is always nagging me to do my homework and then complains that I spend too much time by myself in my room rather than with the family.

Winnie: At least your parents don’t tell you what you can wear. My mom still wants to pick out my clothes! What am I, five?

Finn: My parents are worse. They’re always comparing me to my smarter brothers. I’m a huge disappointment to them. I’m always coming up short.

Winnie: My parents are never satisfied either. They’re always saying that my grades aren’t good enough and my attitude needs improving.

Finn: At least your parents don’t embarrass you by fighting all the time, even in public.

Winnie: We have such hard lives. Nobody understands us.

Finn: I know. Nobody in history has ever suffered as much as we have!

### 1303 Disputing an Incorrect Bill

Regina: Hello, this is Horizon. My name is Regina. How may I help you today?

Bob: I’m calling to dispute my bill. There’s a billing error.

Regina: Let me take a look at your statement. Your last bill was $650 and it is past due.

Bob: It’s past due because this is the third time I’ve called to report the problem, but my bill still hasn’t been corrected. My bill is normally $65 a month.

Regina: I’m looking at your account and I don’t see a record of any previous calls about this problem.

Bob: I called last week and the week before. Look, I just want to get this sorted out so I can pay my bill before my service is disconnected.

Regina: I understand. Your bill may reflect changes you’ve made to your usage plan, such as upgrading to a more expensive plan.

Bob: I’ve made no changes to my usage plan. I’ve had the same plan for eight months.

Regina: Your bill may also reflect overage charges if you went over your allotted minutes or data.

Bob: I haven’t gone over my limit. Can my case be escalated so that I can speak with a supervisor?

Regina: Certainly, sir. Let me have a supervisor call you back when she’s available.

Bob: Will that be today?

Regina: I can’t tell you that, sir.

Bob: I just hope she calls me back before my service is [call ends].

### 1304 Expressing Gratitude

Gina: I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all the people who have helped me along the way . . .

Mark: You’re not going to start your speech with that boring opening, are you?

Gina: It’s not boring. It’s a nice opening.

Mark: It’s too formal and stiff. How about, “Hey, everybody. Thanks a million!”

Gina: That’s too informal.

Mark: Fine, if you say so. What comes next?

Gina: Well, then I say, “I want to wholeheartedly thank those who stuck with us and who never let us down.”

Mark: That’s too impersonal. How about, “Hey Emiliano, you’re totally awesome. And you, Tania? You’re absolutely fab.

Gina: That doesn’t even come close to expressing how I feel. I want to thank people for their thoughtfulness, generosity, and support from the bottom of my heart.

Mark: That’s so sappy! Why don’t you just give props to people who deserve it and a shout-out to the people who helped you? Then, you jump off the stage and walk through the audience to high-five everybody. That’s how I would give a thank-you speech.

Gina: I’ll remember that the next time I speak to a group of 10-year-olds!

### 1305 Saying a Final Goodbye

Lucy: I don’t know how to say goodbye.

Jeff: How about so long, I’m outta here, “I’m leaving on a jet plane” and “in 10 minutes I’ll be late for the door”?

Lucy: No, that’s not what I mean. I mean that it’s hard to say goodbye to something after such a long time. I’ve had a very happy time here.

Jeff: What you really mean to say is, “Parting is such sweet sorrow.” But, “It’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.” “I, I, will always love you.”

Lucy: Stop! Listen, what I want to express is a fond farewell and optimism for the future.

Jeff: Ah, okay! Then you should say: Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life! I’m off to bigger and better things! I’m blowing this pop stand!

Lucy: No, no, no. That’s not right at all. I want to end with some meaningful parting words, something sincere, something from my heart.

Jeff: Like, “May the force be with you”?

Lucy: Hmm . . . how about “Live long and prosper”?

Jeff: Now are you ready to leave?

Lucy: I guess so. It’s been a blast.

Jeff: It’s been a hoot.

Lucy: It’s been an honor and a pleasure.

Jeff: Adiós.

Lucy: Au revoir.

Jeff: Sayonara.

Lucy: Zàijiàn. Zoi gin.

Jeff: Ciao.

Lucy: Auf Wiedersehen.

Jeff: Proshchay.

Lucy: Tchau.

Jeff: Wadaeaan.

Lucy: Annyeong.

Jeff: Toodle loo!

Lucy & Jeff: Thank you and goodbye.
